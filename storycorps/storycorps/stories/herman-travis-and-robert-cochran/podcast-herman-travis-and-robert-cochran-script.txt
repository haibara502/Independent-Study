Herman Travis (HT) and Robert Cochran (RC)
HT: When I first started doing it. People was cautious. They didn’t let me in their house, but after they got to really know me they would just be happy to see me.
RC: You can hear the shopping cart coming down the sidewalk. My wife would say, ”Bobby. Here come Herman.” [Laughs] The amazing thing is how he load that shopping cart up and push it up that hill.
HT: I got it all down pat.
RC: But you always do it with a smile. I sometimes sit back and watch you. And I seen the way you handle yourself with the residents. They know they treated with respect when they see you coming. And there are people in other complexes that have been trying to steal Herman for years…to pay him to come and deliver their food for them.
HT: Oh yeah.
RC: We know. [Laughs] But we’re a close-knit bunch. You know, it’s the little things that you do day in and day out that I admire for the last 8 years. I don’t think you can find a better person to be friends with.
HT: Thank you. I’m doing something that people really need. And that makes me feel really good. So long as I have breath in my body I’m going to continue doing it. I sleep good at night.
