Maya Leonard-Cahn (MLC) and Michael Cahn (MC)
MC: My dad was a pretty serious alcoholic and my mom kept a low profile and just tried to survive and… You know, I remember feeling somewhat lost. I wanted to be a very different kind of parent.
MLC: And parenting four girls–did you ever imagine that?
MC: I never imagined it but when guy friends would say to me, well, don’t you want a boy? I used to say to them, No because I had such a bad experience as a boy that it kind of scares me to be a male role model for a boy. So, I was real happy to have girls and still am.
MLC: How do you think parenting has changed you?
MC: It changed me from the moment my children came onto this earth. Catching you as you emerged onto this world, cutting your umbilical cord, you know, washing you off, was the highest high I think I could ever experience although when you and I walk down the aisle, I know I’m probably going to cry for a week. You know, I caught you with my catchers mitt, maybe I’ll give you away with my catcher’s mitt or something.
MLC: That sounds great. So, what advice do you have for me in thinking about parenting?
MC: You know, anyone can conceive a child–uh, just follow your instincts and you can make a baby. But there’s a lot one can learn about being a parent. I know that what you tell your kids doesn’t matter. What you show them, what you model for them, is everything. And the thing that, um, helped me so much and always has and always will is the love and support and the presence that my daughters allow me to have in their lives. I’m so grateful for that, Maya.
MLC: I’m grateful for you. Thank you for the chance to share this conversation.
MC: I wouldn’t have missed this for the world.
