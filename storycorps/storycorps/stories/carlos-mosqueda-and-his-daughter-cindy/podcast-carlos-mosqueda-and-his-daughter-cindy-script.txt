Carlos Mosqueda (CSM) and Cindy Mosqueda (CM):
CSM: My dad was basically a chiropractor but he didn’t have a license. He would come home from work and in our backyard he had a bench, and he’d have four or five people waiting for him already.
CM: Yeah, he had his workshop back there.
CSM: And my dad never charged for his services. People that played sports would come with a dislocated ankle, shoulder, what have you — they’d come in limping and they would literally leave walking. Dad used to say, ’To him who is upstairs there is no impossible thing.’  Just recently I happened to help a client —
CM: Mhmm.
CSM: — and he said to me, “I used to know a Mr. Mosqueda. They used to live in East L.A. He was a sobador. And when he said that my jaw nearly dropped because I was sitting across the table from him. Then he said,  ’His name was Bartolo.  Any relation to you? And I looked at him in the eyes and I said, ‘That’s my father.’ And tears ran out down his eyes. He said, ’Your father cured my wife when nobody else could.’ Grandpa made an impact like that that has lived on. To have seen him do that, to make a kind of difference like that, it’s an incredible thing.
