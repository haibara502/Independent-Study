Florence Aaron (FA) and Julia Pilowsky (JP)
JP: My name is Julia Pilowsky, I’m, 15 years old, and I’m interviewing my grandmother.
FA: And my name is Florence Aaron.
JP: Tell me about the day you met your husband.
FA: A friend and myself we went up to a little resort at Newburgh, NY. We got there on a Friday night and Saturday morning we sat at a table of maybe 10 people and I sat next to Sam. And I know Julia, you don’t believe in love at first sight, but it definitely was true with us. He was in uniform and I fell for him. There was a dance in the evening and then after the dance we were smooching in his car. When I got home and I didn’t hear from him I was miserable. Moping around uuooohhh it was just terrible. And then he called. Well I went bananas. He said come in and meet me at the New Yorker Hotel which is right near Penn Station. And its a miracle I needed a train, I could’ve flown there. Uh I was in love! I was thinking about this the other day — I remember when we first got married I said, I’m gonna have a lot of children because I want YOU to populate the earth. And I thought we could make the world a better place to live in. Anyway, we got up to four and then we stopped. It was just a romantic loving relationship. And it was a love affair that went on until the day he died. And I’ll never, never get over him.
