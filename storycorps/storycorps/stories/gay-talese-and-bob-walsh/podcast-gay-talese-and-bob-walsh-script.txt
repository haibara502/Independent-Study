Gay Talese (GT) and Bob Walsh (BW)


BW: My oldest brother, he was in the business. There was a demand for a lot of apprentices so my brother asked me if I’d like to work on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. I said, ”Sure, why not?” You know? It was gonna be the biggest bridge in the world at the time.
GT: And you were 18?
BW: Just became 18, yeah.


BW: When I was 11 years old, my father had gotten killed in this business.
GT: And you fell one day…
BW: Yes uh, I would jump from one beam to the other and they were probably about five feet apart and uh, I didn’t make the next beam. And I was fortunate enough that the nets were there. But, we lost a fellow out of local 40, a fellow by the name of McKee. He went through a hole in the catwalk…
GT: …and fell about four or five hundred feet to his death in the water.
BW: Yeah, he did yeah.


GT: Tell us about your children, please, because two of your sons are ironworkers.
BW: They’re ironworkers. Now I’ll have to say the oldest fellow, he got hurt a couple of years ago. A piece of timber came down 11 stories and it hit him in the head. But he came out of it very well, I’ll have to say that. And now he’s got three sons that are ironworkers as well.
GT: Wouldn’t they make more money and take less risks doing something else?
BW: Well, it’s probably not in our blood.


BW: That’s what I think of when I go over the Verrazano Bridge. I’m just a proud ironworker. I really am.
