Beau Harris (BM): Who has been the kindest to you in your life? Kioni Marshall (KM): I would have to say my mother. When I do something and she’s, like, mad, she understands and she tries to lower her temper down. And I think that is kind. BM: Have me and mom ever extremely disappointed you? KM: Yes. She asked me if I wanted to meet my father and I was already five-years-old. And I was wondering like why couldn’t she have said that before. And I was disappointed that she didn’t. If I could do it now, then why couldn’t I have done it when I was four or three or one. And you had disappointed me, Dad, because you have not been in my life for five years. Are you ashamed that you went with sister’s and brother’s mom? BM: No I’m not ashamed. I regret that I didn’t make better decisions when I was younger. And I would’ve took more accountability for everyone’s feelings involved. Have mom and I ever made you extremely proud of us? KM: I have been extremely proud of you when you came to my life. It was a big deal for me. So much when I met you that I started crying when I went home and you didn’t come with us. I was disappointed then, but I’m not now because you’ve gained up those five years and you’ve been in my life ever since. BM: From time to time I’ve become emotionally upset from decisions that I’ve made in the past. But then I appreciate who I evolved into as a person. The man, the father. I’m glad I reached this point. Popcorn, I would like to thank you for your time. KM: I would like to thank you for your time too, Daddy.
