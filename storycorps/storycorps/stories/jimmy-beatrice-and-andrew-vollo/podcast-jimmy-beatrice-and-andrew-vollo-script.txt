Beatrice: In all my 58 years driving a cab, I learned one thing: It’s possible that you could take a job like that and be your own boss and make a living and go to work happy and come home happy. There not many guys like me in the business. Who’s in the business more than 50 years? You only got a handful. But I still like it. I get up there in the morning I tell ya I go out there and I… I like it so much I don’t even wanna charge the people. That’s how much I like it.
