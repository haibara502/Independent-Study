Francisco ”Frankie” Preciado Jr. and Francisco Preciado Sr.
FP Jr: Since I was around nine or ten, I would come sometimes with you to help you on campus.
FP Sr: I remember I told you that one day, you were going to go here to Stanford.
FP Jr: That really stuck with me. And when I also would go with mom to clean houses, I saw the hard work and that set the example for me. So because of you, I applied.
FP Sr: And then, you told us that you had been accepted but you were worried that, “Financially dad, I don’t know if I can go because I don’t have the money.” And I told you, “Your mom and I will do whatever needs to be done.”
FP Jr: When I was on campus, I knew that on Mondays and Fridays you would clean the fountains around 1:15pm, so I would make sure that I would walk that way to go and see you, and check in to see how things were going.
FP Sr: It was a routine, and my friends there at work, they always would tell me, “Oh I saw your son over here, or I’ve seen him over there.” It was like I had extra eyes watching over you.
FP Jr: Do you remember what I told you my graduation day?
FP Sr: Of course. You said, “Dad, this diploma is for you. And I still joke, because we have the diploma at home on the wall, and I go, “No, you can’t take that with you. You told me that was mine, I’m keeping it.”
FP Jr: Reflecting about your life, do you have any regrets?
FP Sr: Yes, I do have one major regret. I was actually going to college to be a teacher, but I had financial problems, so I had to leave school and get a full-time job. And sometimes, I still think about being able to be a teacher, but I feel to me that it’s too late. And to see my son go to Stanford, it’s like a little bit of me there. It gives me a lot of pride.
