(RS: There’s a bond.)
Yeah.
RS: So when I got hit with the kidney disease; I was sick, I had no job. I was lonely. And then Felix called me.
FA: We were talkin for awhile and you told me that you had kidney disease. I was like, ’But you don’t got nobody that’ll donate?’ So, you know, here I am. I’m in good health. Plus I wanted to do something good in my life for the first time. You know, all I’ve done is like mischief and
(RS: Start trouble.)
Well I don’t start trouble. Trouble finds me.
(RS: Yeah, I’ve heard that before.)
I was like, What’s up so, what about me? You think I could get tested? I mean like I got mad tattoos so I don’t know if I could donate. So then you were like, ’Yeah right whatever. Alright Felix.’ And then you just kept on brushin it off. And I kept on tellin you.
RS: The day that I believed it was the day that we went in for our last check up. And we’re sitting down, and Felix has a Plaxico Burress jersey on. And they’re checkin me and they’re checkin Felix. And Felix looked up and said, ’Look, I wanna do this.’ That’s when I knew that it was..was on. And sometimes when I’ll play the MegaMillions (laughs)
I’ll play the MegaMillions and, you don’t know this. And I lose. I’m okay with it because I felt like I won already. Cuz he saved my life. What greater gift is that. That was my million dollars.
