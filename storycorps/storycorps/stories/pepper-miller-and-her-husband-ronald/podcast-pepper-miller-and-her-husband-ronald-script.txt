Pepper Miller (PM): I think in our marriage, it was all about you. You were the man — mack daddy. And so, I got to a point where I didn’t want it to be about you. I wanted it to be about me.
Ronald Miller (RM): I thought you were spending a lot more time on your friends than you were with our marriage.
PM: The divorce was amicable. But, we went to the same church and you moved to the other side of the church (laughs).
RM: I did.
PM: I felt like giving you the finger several times. Um, you dated people and I dated other people.
RM: But, uh … you know… I missed you.
PM: Remember you called me and you had the flu?
RM: Oh yeah.
PM: And I came and made you soup. I remember smelling your cologne, you know, after having to tuck you in.
RM: Yeah, we started having lunch and, uh, I mentioned getting back together. But you said, “No.” And, something happened and…
PM: Well, it was one of my girlfriends that talked to me. She said, “You know Pepper, you are constantly comparing Ron to other people. The problem with this one, the problem with that one is that they are not Ron.” So, I hung up the phone and I called you and — and we started dating. And it was good. And I remember I took my dad on a cruise. I opened my suitcase and there was this long letter from you asking me to marry you. It was very, uh, romantic. And that was in August. And in December, we were married, man.
RM: Right. Eight years the first time. We were divorced five years. And uh, December it will be ten years we’re married again.
PM: I’m still excited to be with you, snuggle with you and smell that cologne. I mean, we still have our bumps, huh?
RM: Oh yeah, and we’ll always have our bumps, I’m sure. But we’ve learned that there’s nobody that we’d rather be with than each other.
PM: I love you.
RM: I love you, too.
