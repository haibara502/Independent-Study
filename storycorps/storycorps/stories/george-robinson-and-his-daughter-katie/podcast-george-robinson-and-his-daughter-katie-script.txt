George Robinson (GR): As I was growing up, various relatives would share little bits about my biological father. I heard that he was a sergeant in the Army. I also heard that he worked in food service in the Army; and the service wouldn’t use leftovers, and he would take that food and give it to poor people. Which made me really want to get to know him, a person that would do that.
Katie Robinson (KR): So what was it like when you finally got to meet your father in person?
GR: When I pulled up to the house, we met at the doorstep and he put his hands on my face and then touched my knees, each of my knees, and then he took his hands and put his hands next to mine, like he was trying to feel was I really his son, and he said, ”You know I dated a beautiful lady for a short time, and I did not know anything about you.”And I said, ”Listen: I want to, in the time that we have, know everything about you.”
KR: And to tell you what kind of man he was, as my mom was on her dying bed he asked to go visit my mom, and I said, ”No she wouldn’t want you to see her in this condition.” But I said, ”I don’t think my mom is going to be here for very long and when she passes you’re welcome to come to her funeral.” My mom did pass, and he came, and sat right in back of me and had his hand on my shoulder the entire service, and he gave everybody in the family a red rose to set on my mom’s casket as we lowered it underground.
GR: I…I felt that I lost one part of me, but I found another part of me.
