CL: One day some guy showed up to him and say, “Um, we’re going to make some movie. Can you write a script?” Father said, “Sure.” After he wrote the script, then they say, “The director just disappeared. Can you just direct the movie too?” He said, “Oh, sure. No problem.” And, actually, at the last minute they couldn’t find the main actor. And then they say, “How about you play that role, too?” He say, “Okay. Sure.” And that’s how he started with his movie business.
JL: How would you describe him as a person?
CL: Father was, actually, not such a nice person to most people. He was extremely temper…ment…
JL: Temperamental
CL: Temperamental. Right. And if didn’t like somebody, he didn’t hide anything. But towards me, he never really raised his voice. The story was, as soon as I was born, I smiled him. And he felt, we have such a relationship. I don’t know if I was really smiling or just kinda make a face. Supposedly I would not fall asleep unless I’m in his arm. Then he would hold me on his left arm and he would write with his right hand. Father and me, we have the closest bond among all people.
