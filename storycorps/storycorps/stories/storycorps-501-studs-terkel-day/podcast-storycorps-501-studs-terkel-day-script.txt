		The great oral historian Studs Terkel has been an inspiration to StoryCorps. We recognize his birthday, May 16th, as an official holiday, called Studs Terkel Day.Studs was also an early StoryCorps participant. In 2005, we drove our MobileBooth to his home and recorded his musings on “vox humana” — the human voice. In celebration of Studs Terkel Day, we remember one of our heroes with that interview.
