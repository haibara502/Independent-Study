These are stories about taking the long view and sticking it out, and times when persistence and patience paid off.Our first story comes from Bob Heft (pictured above). He was interviewed at his home in Saginaw, Michigan, surrounded by dozens of American flags. Bob has a particular claim on our current flag: he designed it as a high school student for an American history class assignment. There was a problem, though—Bob’s flag had fifty stars on it, and, at the time, there were only 48 states. He had a hunch that more would be added soon, and it turned out, Bob was right. Bob went on to become a public school teacher, college professor, and mayor of Napoleon, Ohio, before he passed away in 2009.It started in 1958 at a roller-skating rink on the Indian Head naval base in Maryland, where Peter Headen met a girl named Jackie (pictured together at left). He introduced himself, and so began a love story that spans one war, three countries, and four decades.
