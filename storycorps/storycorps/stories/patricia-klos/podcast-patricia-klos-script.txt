Patricia Klos: My mother and father owned the Silver State lodge motel. My dad would come home, he’d say, ”Well, got another divorce today.” And my mom’d say, ”Oh yeah, who got divorced today?” And he’d say, ”Well, you know Mrs. So-and-so, lived in Elm?”. And it was primarily women who came to Reno to file for divorce. Often they were very sad, they were very lonesome, they had left their families behind. So my mother felt sorry for them and she would often visit with them. And there were a couple that after they left they actually gave clothes to my mom. They didn’t want to wear those divorce clothes.
