Danny Perasa (DP) and Annie Perasa (AP)
DP: She started to talk, and I said listen I’m going to deliver a speech and I said at the end you’re gonna want to go home. I said you represent a dirty four letter word, I said that word is love. I says if we’re going anywhere we’re going down the aisle because I’m too tired, too sick and too sore to do any other damn thing. And she turned around and she said, of course I’ll marry you. And the next morning I called her as early as I possibly could –
AP: And he always gets up early – (laughs)
DP: – to make sure she hadn’t changed her mind, and she hadn’t. And every year on April 22 around three o’clock, I call her and ask her if it was today would she do it again, and so far the answer’s been the same.
AP: Yeah, twenty -five times yes. (laughs)
DP: You see, the thing of it is, I always feel guilty when I say I love you, to you, and I say it so often, I say it to remind you that as dumpy as I am, it’s coming from me- it’s like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio. And it’s nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
AP: If I don’t have a note on the kitchen table, I think there’s something wrong. You write a love letter to me every morning
DP: The only thing that could possibly be wrong is that I couldn’t find a silly pen
AP: To my princess, the weather out today is extremely rainy, I’ll call you at eleven twenty in the morning –
DP: It’s a romantic weather report.
AP: -And I love you, I love you, I love you.
DP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work, no matter what happens in the rest of the day, there’s a shelter when you get home, there’s a knowledge, knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you down the stairs and saying get your hands off me. Being married is like having a color television set, you never want to go back to black and white.
