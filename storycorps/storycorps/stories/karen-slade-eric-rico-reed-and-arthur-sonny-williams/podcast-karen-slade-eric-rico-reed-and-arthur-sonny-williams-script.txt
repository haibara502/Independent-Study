Karen Slade (KS): I’m Karen Slade; I’m the general manager of KJLH radio. We were prepared for people to be unhappy, but we couldn’t believe our eyes. People were beyond angry. They were crazy. It’s like they lost their mind. The phone started lighting up, and my jocks shut down the music, they stayed on the mic, they took the calls and probably for the next three days, we just became all talk…





Eric Reed (ER): My name is Eric ”Rico” Reed. Where we sat, our studio, we had a picture window. And it was just like looking at a movie screen. And we’re looking right across the street at the TV repair shop. And we’re watching people take something, throw it through the window, grab a broken TV, and I say, ”I can’t believe this guy. It’s a TV repair shop. The TVs don’t even work….”

ER: It was crazy.



Arthur Williams (AW): My name is Arthur Williams. We saw an Hispanic guy; he was being beat severely. And a black priest went out in the middle of the street and held his bible up and draped his-self over the guy that everybody was beating, and, uh, they dispersed. You know, what he did was unbelievable. So, I said he’s a hero.
MUSIC ER: It took almost forever to get stores back in the community that were burnt to the ground.
KS: It was very disheartening. But the knuckleheads were few. They were devastating and they had a horrible impact but they didn’t destroy the community. One lady came out, and she had some of the neighborhood kids and she got them brooms and everybody was sweeping. They were cleaning up Crenshaw. I had never seen it before [laughs].
ER: There were just so many things that were in our community. Our community wasn’t perfect, but it was gorgeous. And some areas haven’t come back and probably never will.
