LH: My dad got his leg cut off in a farming accident and at that time the artificial legs was made out of paper with varnish and they were put around a mold and there was cables in the ankles that connected the leg to the foot. There were some interesting times with that old leg. One time we were delivering mining materials and there was a timber checker that was up on top of the truck and he had to look at every timber that we were unloading and dad had pulled one of those timbers out and he stepped and got his artificial leg caught and as he turned it let out a pretty loud pop and he said, ”oh darn, I think I broke my foot.” and he sat down on the running board of the truck and the foot was plainly broken it was turned at a right angle to what it should be and he caught his foot in his two hands and he straightened it up and it cracked and popped something awful and said, ”oh darn, the thing is broke.” and he climbed back up on the truck and that timber checker had turned white as cotton and we didn’t think anything about it. Several years later, Uncle Lon, dad’s brother, had run into the guy and he asked him, ”Are you any kin to that Vaunia Hill, that used to deliver mining materials?” Uncle Lon says, ”Sure thats my brother.” The timber checker said, ”I’ll tell you one thing. That is the toughest man I ever seen. He broke his foot and climbed back up and finished unloading that truck.” Uncle Lon was laughing so hard tears were rolling down his cheeks. But he never did tell the guy that it was an artificial leg.
