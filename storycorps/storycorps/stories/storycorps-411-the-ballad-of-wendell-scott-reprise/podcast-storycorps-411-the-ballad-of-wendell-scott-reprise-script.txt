His family served as his racing team (his sons worked as his pit crew), and traveled with him to speedways across the country from their home in Danville, Virginia, as he became the first African American to win races at NASCAR’s elite major league level.Wendell Scott died in 1990 at the age of 69, and one of his sons, Frank, and his grandson, Warrick, came to StoryCorps to remember him.This month, we released an animation based on the conversation between Frank and Warrick. “Driven,” which you can watch below, was directed by Julie Zammarchi and first screened this week at the NASCAR Hall of Fame High Octane Theater in Charlotte, North Carolina.
