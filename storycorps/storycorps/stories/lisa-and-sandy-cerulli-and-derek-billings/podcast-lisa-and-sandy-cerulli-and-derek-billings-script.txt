DB: Lisa, who is your best friend?
LC: I just recently lost somebody who is very much like my best friend. She was my cousin, Angela. She was 9 years older than I was. I always thought she was cool. And she used to treat me with a lot of respect. And we were the only two girls in the family. I remember when I was 14 years old she told me that when she got married, she wanted me to be her maid of honor. And when she married Dennis 3 years later, I was her maid of honor. And then, she was mine. And she was godmother to my daughter. And no matter what, Angela was somebody that I always felt like I could talk to. I could tell her anything. And I really have a hole in my heart for her because Even two weeks ago, my daughter, she was potty trained and she could go poopy on the potty. And I said, I got to call Angela and tell And I just kinda stopped, because I realized that I couldn’t tell her.
I always thought she was going to be there. And we were gonna, you know, we would talk about our children and our husbands and we would be there when our daughters got married and when our daughters did things as teenagers. And that’s something that I really I’m really, really going to miss.
