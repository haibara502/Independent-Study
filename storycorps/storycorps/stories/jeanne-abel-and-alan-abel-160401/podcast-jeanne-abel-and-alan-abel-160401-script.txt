Jeanne Abel (JA), Alan Abel (AA), and Yetta Bronstein (YB)
JA: I ran in 1964 and 1968.
 JA: I only appeared on radio because I was in my 20s and I was blonde and not a Jewish mother.
There was of course, this question where is she? So, Alan gave everybody a photo of his mother.
 ALAN ABEL: We had followers go down to Atlantic City where they had the Democratic Convention. And we were marching up and down with about 20 people, with our signs, ”Vote for Yetta and Things Will Get Betta”…
 JA: “Clean Sweep With Yetta”… I was on a broomstick with a broom…
 AA: And then, “Why Not?” That’s all. “Why Not,” question mark. Nothing more on the placard.
 AA: When you were running for President, you wanted them to recognize hermaphrodites, you remember? You wanted them to be able to vote twice. You wanted to take Congress off salary and put them on straight commission… Allow guns in homes but decrease the velocity of bullets by 95 percent.
AA: And of course, you lost by a landslide.
 JA: They said I didn’t win a single precinct.
 JA: You know not once in all the interviews I did…
JA: … not once did the host say “Well, you are kidding aren’t you?” Which was interesting in itself.
 JA: I don’t think Yetta has a place in this particular election season. I mean, people have asked me don’t you want to get in the race? I said, no, the comedy is already happening.
