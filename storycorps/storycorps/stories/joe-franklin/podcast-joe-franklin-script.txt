(Sound of phones ringing and general hubbub in Joe Franklin’s.)
DAVE ISAY: On the sixth floor of an old Times Square building, Joe Franklin’s cramped office looks tornado stricken. It’s permeated with the musty, Lysol-tinged smells rising from the multiplex sex emporium that occupies the floors below.
There are stacks of old coffee cups, moldy half-eaten bagels, and shopping bags full of yellow newspaper clippings everywhere. And of course there is the architect of it all — Joe Franklin, sitting at the front of the office all day, working his two rotary phones.
(Phone rings.)
JOE FRANKLIN  Hello?
 He says he gets about a thousand calls a day from hopefuls trying to land a spot on his nightly talk show. He fields each one with that Joe Franklin flair.
FRANKLIN  Richard, I want to tell you something. I got so many surprises for you. Let’s talk tonight at 7: 00. Promise? It’s critical!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Dan I need you maniacally, pathologically!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Tell him that things are concretizing. Things are coming together. They’re coagulating!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Very important, Rosalyn!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Put it on the critical list, critical!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Give me a hint! Give me a clue!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Tell him give me one more day to think!
(Slam)
FRANKLIN  Call back in a half hour!
(Slam. Slam. Slam.)
 Once or twice a year the phone actually explodes, like an artery, like a heart attack. There might be 900 people trying to get through at one time. It actually gets a stroke and the dial blows out. Believe it or not.
 There’s a lot that’s hard to believe about Joe Franklin. From the fact that this is his new office — he just moved in two months ago, although it looks like he’s been here for decades — to the fact that he’s hosted something like 28,000 episodes of his talk show over the past 40 years.
In that time Joe Franklin says he’s interviewed 150,000 guests. Some of them famous — like Elvis Presley, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. Most of them not so famous . . .
 I’ve had dancing dentists, singing lawyers, people who play the piano standing on their heads, cabdrivers who do handwriting analysis . . .. You name it, I’ve had it. And if I haven’t had it, I’ll create it.
FRANKLIN  Yeah, yeah, Fred, let me play it now. Give me a buzz on Friday morning — I’ll make you happy. God bless you!
(Slam)
