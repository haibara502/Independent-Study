DADADRIANDADADAD: Showtime… Showtime.
: I love your voice.
: Can you understand it?
: Yes.
: Alright, let me hear it.
: Say something.
: How are you this evening?
: Can you hear yourself?
: Absolutely.
A: 
D: I’m laying here while the reporter is establishing contact with the patient.
A: 
DAD:: I’m not sure what trip we’re on.
: So what trip are we on?
 I dunno. We’re on a trip of exploration into the feelings of a, I don’t know what you’d call me, I’m in my eighties and it’s an exploration of my physical condition, which is very serious about which we have no definitive answer and I think only time will resolve it.
A: 
DADAADADADAAADAD: I wonder what the hell I weigh.
: I’d say you’re pretty skinny.
: Yeah, I would say. A hundred pounds, maybe.
: Yeah.
: Now, what was your average weight?
: My average weight was around 160.
: 160.
: 163.
: Yup. You want to close your eyes a little?
: A little, yeah. But I won’t go anywhere; I’ll stay right—right here, okay?
: Okay.
: Lemme take your glasses.
: I love you very much.
: I love you very much.
: And just bang the spoon if you need me.
: I sure will.
DAEVEDE: Hi, sweetie.
: G’mornin, Mom.
: Morning, Adrian.
: Morning, Hon.
: Good Morning.
A: 
EDEDED: I love you.
: Love you. Have a good sleep, huh?
: I did.
: Why don’t you make yourself a coffee or something?
: I will. Quite a morning.
: Yep.
A:


ADAD: You looked a little squished up to me.
: I’ve moved around this morning a little.
: Do you want to try and get your butt up a little, or are you okay?
: This is good.
A: 

EDAEDED: I was looking at all those pictures last night and I thought our children had a pretty nice childhood.
: Yeah.
: —a lot of happy pictures—
: A lot of happy times.
: We did have a lot of happy times.
: We had busy times too.
: Yeah.
A: 

AADADADAD: Then, ready.
: One, two, good, and let it down.
: Want to do one more.
: Yeah?
: Okay? One.
: And bend it up.
: Okay.
: Great, great.
: Phew.
A: 
D: Don’t be afraid to use your famous scrub.
A: 
DADDADAAAD: Is the water running into the buckets or whatever it is?
: Yup, it’s running where it’s supposed to.
: Good.
: Oh. Okay. What is that noise?
:—that’s the water draining—
: Draining.
: —safely away from your bed.
: Okay. Close your eyes, Daddy, ’cause this one’s going to spill in your eyes a little bit. There.
: So, what I’m gonna do, Daddy, now, is I just want to put your shirt on so you don’t get a chill.
: Okay.
A: 
D: Here we go again talking — and I’m being recorded, I think, I hope I am, by my daughter.
DADAD: Oh, I’ve got my teeth out and everything. Talk about miscombulated, or whatever the goddamn word…
: Discombobulated.
: Discombobulated. How’s that?
: Can you spell it? That’s what you’d make me do as a child.
: Dis—”D-I-S”…
A: 
DA: I wonder what it is that I, I’m so intrigued with words. Oh well.
: You’ve always loved words.
A: 


ADADADADADADADADA: I hope, I hope when I’m an old woman, if I’m lucky enough to get to be a old woman—
: Yeah.
: I hope I will have brought joy to people’s lives like you did.
: Oh, you already have.
: But I mean, like, you also fought for people, Daddy.
: I was one of many.
: I know. But you’re the one I love the most.
: I’m the one that you knew the most, yeah. (.)
: You’re the one I knew the most and you’re the one I love the most.
: You love the most and knew the most.
: Yeah. Love the most first.
: Yeah.
: () You’re so funny.
: You’re so funny.
: Sweet dreams. I love you.
: () Love you too.
: Signing off.
A: 

DAD: How long have I been sleeping?
: You’ve been sleeping about 8 hours. You woke up a few times.
: Oh.
A: 

DADADADAD: Is your mother sleeping?
: She’s dead to the world. She’s very sad today.
: Huh.
: I think she’s gonna miss you.
: Yeah.
: Must be scary, I would think. All those years you get so used to being with someone.
: Or calling somebody for something. Or sharing.
: Cuddling with someone.
: Sure.
A: 
ADAADADADADADAD: Daddy, is your chest hurting where I’m hugging you?
: No, no.
: I feel so sad.
: I feel like so many changes are happening.
: Um hum. Yeah.
: They’re just changing and I can’t change it from changing.
: Some things you can’t change. Yeah.
: I’m going to be fine though. You know that.
: Yep.
: I’m very, very strong.
: I know you are, honey.
: I just feel like you’re my um, you’re like my soul mate. You know?
: Mm-hmm. We just love each other.
: Some comfort I am. Clinging to a sick man in a hospital bed crying on his skinny chest ().
: My silly, my silly. And you’re recording it all besides. ()
A: 
ADAD: You can go to sleep, I’ll watch you go to sleep.
: I’m just going to close my eyes.
: You do that, go ahead. I’m just going to sit with you quietly.
: You don’t have to be quiet.
A: 
DADADADAADADADADADADADAD: (whispering) If you can open my leg.
: You wanna move your legs?
: Yeah. I’ve been moving my legs.
: You’ve always been moving your legs, Daddy. You’ve walked a lot of miles.
: Oh.
: You walked miles—remember, you hopped trains?
: When?
: Oh, from when you were a young man.
: You wanna see your legs?
: Yeah.
: Okay, they’re very skinny.
: Yeah.
: Look. Can you see them?
: OK. Where’s my teeth?
: Your teeth are in the bathroom. Your legs are attached to your hobblety hips. Where are you?
: () Front room.
: Front room. That’s right.
: You are kind.
: It’s easy to be kind to you.
: You are gentle.
: Gentle?
: Gentle looking.
: You look so beautiful, Daddy.
: You are gentle.
A: 
AEEDADAEAEA: Daddy. It’s Adrian Nicole.
: It’s a pretty name, Adrian Nicole, isn’t it? And I insisted it be spelled the way your name is spelled: A-D-R-I-A-N. Because I loved you.
: Are you in pain?
: No.
: Daddy it’s getting—the sun is setting and the trees look so beautiful in the back yard. The little red house that you helped build me that I used to play in. Yup.
: I love you.
: I love you.
: I’ll take a kiss. () I’m holding your hand. Okay?
: You’re such a good man, Daddy, such a good man.
: You can let go.
: You did your work. All done.
