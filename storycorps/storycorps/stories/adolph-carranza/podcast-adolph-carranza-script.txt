Adolph Carranza: We were pretty poor and the school told the Salvation Army and the Salvation Army came and they brought some canned goods and things of that sort there. And they had one or two cans of this cranberry stuff that we didn’t know what it was and my grandma, she put it away, nobody wanted it. And during the winters–well, during the winters it was kind of rough. My momma and my grandma said, Well, open that can, see what it is! And I opened it up and it was a jelly form type of thing and I told my brother, You want to taste it and he said, No, I don’t want to taste it, it’s red, I don’t know what it is!
So I kind of touched it and it was kind of sweet and I said man, this is sugary, and I got a spoon and…It was great! And, uh, my momma would make corn tortillas and we would put the cranberry stuff in there, you know, and then we would eat it.
So then when the Salvation Army would come again, I’d grab those cans and I’d put them away, hide them, and then me and my kid brother, we’d go outside and we’d open it just with a spoon–no tortilla, no nothing.
