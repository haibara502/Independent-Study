Martin Levin: There was a girl in the class that I was in who was the most obnoxious, most difficult and most awful person I’ve ever met in my life. When I was put up as president of the student body, she created a groundswell against me and I lost that job. And I hated her. So, I married her. (Laughter).
Uh, that was the only way to get back at her. That marriage lasted 67 years.
Zoe Crowe: What is the hardest thing you’ve ever done?
ML: Deal with grief. That’s hard for me. I had a relationship with my wife that was so complete that we did everything together. And so, when she died, I found a big vacuum of time open. I don’t mind taking the dog for a walk, but that only takes about a half hour or so. (Laughter).
Big problem is, everybody’s given up on finding me a girlfriend.
Jennifer Goebel: That is not what I heard. (Laughter).
ML: I tell ya, I have lots of ladies who are fun to be with. This woman lives right down the street — really is a lovely lady. And I had an extra seat for the opera. She very graciously came, and fell asleep right on my shoulder. And at intermission, she got up and looked around and said, ”Oh my God, I’ve been sleeping on your shoulder.” I said, ”That’s alright, you’re the first woman I’ve slept with in six years.” (Laughter)
Listen, I’ve had a great life.
ZC: You’re still having a great life. (Laughter)
ML: Yeah, well I feel that every day I get up is a new learning experience for me.
