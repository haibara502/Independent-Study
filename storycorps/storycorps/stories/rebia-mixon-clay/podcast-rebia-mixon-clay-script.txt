Rebia Mixon-Clay (RMC)
RMC: I was pregnant when I met him. And he saw me, and walked over towards me and he said, ”You are going to be my wife.” And a year later we just, one day went down to City Hall and got married. And we had no rings. He tried to give me his class ring, big ugly thing to put on my finger. And I was like, ”Uh uhh.” And I remember coming home one day and he was not there and there was a note on the  back of the door. And it said go in the bedroom and look on the dresser. And I went in the bedroom and looked on the dresser, and there was the ring box. A beautiful wedding ring and engagement ring in the box. I grabbed those rings I done put them on, I just ran out the house ’cause I knew where he hung out at. And when he saw me coming he said, ”Did you find them?” And I was like, yeah, and I was shaking and stuff like I had just met him and I handed him the rings and he got down on one knee, he said ”Would you be my wife, really be my wife?”  And I said yeah.
He would come home and he would say, what is for dinner and I would tell him whatever dinner was going to be and he made me feel like it was magnificent. I mean if I burned popcorn it was the best. You know? That was the kind of guy he was.
I was married to him for 17 years and we separated. And he moved to Michigan. I don’t know the details but Frank got into an altercation, they say that this woman was a damsel in distress and Frank was helping her and the woman’s boyfriend shot him in the back.
I had my fourth child with him. And he’s exactly like his father, exactly. He never talks above a whisper, he’s always happy and laughing.  He is the gentlemen of all gentlemen.  And even my other three kids are like that. Because they had him. My oldest son he will tell you my biological father’s name is, so and so, but my daddy’s name is Frank Mixon.  And out of all the years that we were separated I still remember Frank Mixon. Because I honestly believe he was my first true love.
