AC: Oh, he was a high adventurer. (Laughter) He was…
JC: High energy.
AC: High energy. He would love to jump off of heights. He loved bungee jumping. He got me to bungee jump. (Laughter). I think he was very proud of me for going off. But I did it.
JC: (Laughter) Yes.
AC: His father, he knew better, but me…He always was always getting me into it.
JC: We took–this was before our third child was born–we took the two older ones, Welles and his sister Honor, down to Disney World. Welles was 5 and Honor was 3. At that time they didn’t have all these other wonderful rides, but they had Space Mountain. We got on Space Mountain, we got in this car, and it’s just the 4 of us. And Welles was right up front, and I’m right behind him. And this thing just takes off into the dark, and we’re whipping around. And Welles, I could sense, he was just, he was just vibrating.
AC: (Laughs)
JC: So happy and thrilled to be on this thing. When we got to the bottom all Welles could say was ”Again! Again!”
AC: Right. Got to go again. Come on, Dad. Let’s go.
JC: So I had to take him and the 2 of us rode that darn thing again.
JC: He was born 5/17/77. At 11:50 p.m. Tuesday.
AC: On a Tuesday.
JC: He was Tuesday’s child. You know, Monday’s child is fair faced and Tuesday’s child is full of grace. He was born on Tuesday. He died on a Tuesday. And his body was recovered on a Tuesday. He was truly Tuesday’s child.
