Rita Giordano (RG) and Teresa Giordano (TG)
TG: What would you like to see carried forward, something that you took from your parents, either in terms of values or skills?
RG: What I would like to see most carried forward is honesty, integrity and peace. Poppy used to say, Don’t ever let me find out that you took one rubber band or one clip or one anything from the five and dime. You want anything, you ask for it. No such thing as pilfering; no such thing as fighting unless somebody strikes you first.
TG: How would like to be remembered?
RG: I think you know that there are lots of times I had to intervene, and I had to be patient
TG: You mean with Dad
RG: With, yeah, with Dad. [laughter] Yes, you know that. And, I think I held on pretty well to peace in the family. In fact, there are two things I’d like to make public right now: when I die I’d like to have my maiden name as well as my married name on my stone
TG: Okay
RG: Rita Giordano, I’m proud of that, but nee Ianuzzi, and you might say I strove for peace.
