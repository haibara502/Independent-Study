That was our answer to the day after Thanksgiving becoming widely recognized as a national day of shopping—“Black Friday.” The Great Thanksgiving Listen is a continuation of that project.One major difference between the two initiatives, the National Day of Listening and the Great Thanksgiving Listen, is that we now have the technology to make listening and preserving your stories in the Library of Congress easier than ever. When we debuted the free StoryCorps app in March, it gave all people with access to a smartphone the ability to easily set up an interview, record it, edit it, share it, and then have it archived.By any measure, the Great Thanksgiving Listen was a success. Over the course of a few days, tens of thousands of conversations were recorded, and more than 50,000 of those have been uploaded to the  website and archived at the  at the Library of Congress.The stories that came in were revealing and funny and intense and personal. As we hoped, an incredible number of people sat down with their grandparents or another elder, who with a little prompting, shared their happiest and proudest memories, as well as difficult moments they overcame over the course of their lives. They also shared advice for younger generations that no matter how it was worded, essentially boiled down to a few simple recommendations: Treat others with respect, do a lot of different things with your life, be adventurous, and have a lot of fun because time moves quickly.So before you know it, it will be time for the Great Thanksgiving Listen II. But until then, enjoy just a small bit of the great audio uploaded over the past few weeks.
