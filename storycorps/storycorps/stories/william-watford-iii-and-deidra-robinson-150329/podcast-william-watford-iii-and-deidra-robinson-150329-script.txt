Deidra Robinson (DR) and William Watford III (WW)
DR: I looked at you and I said, ‘Do you want to hear it?’ Do you remember what you told me?
WW: No.
DR: You was like, ’No, I, I don’t want to hear it.’
WW: You know, you was my first girl, and then when you hit me with that gay thing it kind of like, threw me for a whammy. I wasn’t ready for that.
DR: Two years we didn’t talk, two and a half years.
WW: Yeah.
DR: I’m a daddy’s girl, and I missed just talking to you, I missed your stupid jokes, like the weird sayings you say.
WW: I never told you a stupid joke.
DR: Daddy!
WW: [Laughs] Yeah, well, the kind of relationship me and you we used to have? You know I missed that. That’s what tore my heart out.
DR: So it tore your heart out that I was…gay?
WW: Yeah. But, I done growed a whole lot since then, sweetie.
DR: You have, you absolutely have.
WW: I’m just glad we got a relationship where we communicate now like we used to. If I wanted my baby back, I just have to come on back and accept what you was [sic].
DR: So now that it’s over, do you have to deal with having to listen to people saying things to you about the fact that I’m a lesbian?
WW: No, because they know that I would chop them up, chew them up, and spit them out. ’Cause don’t come at me actin’ crazy about my kids.
DR: We’ve done a complete 180. We’re vacationing together. You call my wife almost every day like, you, you think that’s your friend, right? [Laughs]
WW: She is my friend.
DR: (Laughs) We need you. This family needs you.
WW: I’m just being a grandaddy, that’s all. So I just got to do what I’m supposed to do and play my role.
DR: So we’re back to where we used to be. I think.
WW: Yep, it’s better than it was. It’s like a weight been lifted off of me.
