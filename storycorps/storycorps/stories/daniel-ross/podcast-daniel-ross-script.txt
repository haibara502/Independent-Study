DR: That first night we were just dripping sweat. Can’t see nothing. Coughing. Eyes are all watering. And these trees just exploding in front of me. I was horrified. I was scared. I mean, it’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever done in my life.
But when we go on the fires, people treat you different. Even if they do know you’re an inmate, alls they see is a hard working person that’s helping them. And it feels great.
Last year we got called to this town of Saratoga. And we worked for two weeks. And then, at the end of our stay, townspeople wanted to donate us a prime rib dinner. Now, we don’t get prime rib very much here in prison. And I’d noticed that these people that were waiting on us in this really fancy, beautiful restaurant, were like in plain-Jane clothes.
Well, right before we got our main course, the owners came up, and they said, ”I want to introduce you guys to the people that volunteered to help wait on you tonight.”
And all these townspeople got up and gave their testimonies. And they said that we helped save their lives, you know. And I was just overwhelmed to see it in their eyes and to hear it in their voices.
It was so moving that I had to get up and go compose myself. And that was my proudest moment, hands down.
