Gus Hernandez (GH) and Siddiqi Hansoti (SH)
GH: I got an eviction notice from the agency that took over the, uh, the loan. We spent a couple of nights in the car and I told my wife, Look, uh, we can’t stay in the car tomorrow. We have the kids. I looked through the yellow Pages and found El Dorado Motel. I came in and, uh, I inquired about his weekly rates and I said, Look, you know, I’m looking for a room, I don’t have all the money but I got $50 in my pocket and, uh, he says, Put that away. I’ll trust you.
SH: I like this, Mr. Hernandez. I observe his family and I think he is a nice man. He’s soft-speaking guy. He stay, how many days you stay in motel then? From the beginning?
GH: Three weeks I believe. And then I said, you know, I don’t have any more money. And I don’t want to owe you any money so I’m going to have to leave.
SH: And I needed a handy man so I tell them, I give you the job, and you work with me and you stay in my motel also.
GH: I have, uh, a way of making it now. When you can provide for your family, that’s what makes you feel good. And I just needed a little bit of help. You know, you lent me a hand in a time that nobody did.
SH: I’m happy still, I am happy to help. That’s no problem.
GH: When I had money I had a lot of friends. But when I didn’t, Sid was there. So when I’m working for you I’m your employee; after work, I’m your friend. You know?
SH: Thank you.
