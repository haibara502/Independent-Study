Charlie Brotman (CB) and Tom Wiener (TW)
CB: Opening Day, 1956. It was the Yankees versus the Senators, and I went to Griffith Stadium. I had never done stadium announcing before, and here I am introducing Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford. And in addition to introducing all these famous baseball stars, I introduce the President of the United States throwing out the first pitch, —
TW: —and that was?
CB: —which is traditional. Presdient Eisenhower.
TW: Okay.
CB: I was so excited. After the game, I raced home. I talked to my wife Sada, S-A-D-A. And I said, you won’t believe this, but there’s no question. I’ve gotta be the most powerful man in the world.
TW: [chuckles]
CB: I mean people like Mickey Mantle, the world’s greatest baseball player, had to wait for me to introduce him before he took the field. If that wasn’t enough, I introduced the President of the United States who could not do anything until I said Mr. President, would you throw out the first ball? My God, you won’t believe how important that I am! And she says, —
TW: [chuckles] Yeah.
CB: —“Charlie, I want to hear all about it, but would you take the trash out first?” [laughter] And I said “The trash, do you know to whom you’re speaking? The most important guy in the world?” [laughter] She burst my bubble, and when I came back from taking out the trash, —
TW: Yes…
CB: —she said, “Okay, please tell me about—“ “I said, it wasn’t really anything.” [laughter] They have an expression. If you find a job that you really enjoy, you’ll never work a day in your life. I fulfilled that slogan, that saying, that admonition of wisdom, and I’ve been a happy camper.
