Horace Atwater Jr. (HA) and Adrian Hawkins (AH)
 
HA: You were this little, skinny kid [Laughs], about 14. You didn’t really have any clothes. You had mismatched socks.
AH: I remember times being hungry, seeing drugs and all kinds of stuff. I mean, some things had to happen for me to be in foster care, but I’m glad I’m with you.
HA: Thank you. I’m glad you’re with me too.
AH: Why do you care so much for a stranger?
HA: I had a personal experience where I lost everything–a wife, two fine sons–because of drug addiction and anger. I didn’t experience my own sons growing up. I would only see them on visitation periods, but when my wife remarried, she married a man that embraced my sons as though they were his own. He has been an excellent father to them, and I am so grateful that he embraced them the way he did. I’m also grateful for the opportunity that I had to embrace you. So, that’s the least that I owe–the least I could do.
AH: I mean, you know you had it good at one time. And I know you messed it up, but you’re the most influential person in my life, like, I’m just glad that I met you.
HA: I am so glad that you came into my life, and you’re doing so well. You know, it makes me look like I’m smart, but you’re the one who’s smart [Laughter.] God, for you to become the man that you are, I am so proud of that.
