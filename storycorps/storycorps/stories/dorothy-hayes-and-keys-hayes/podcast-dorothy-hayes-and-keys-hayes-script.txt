Dorothy Hayes (DH) and Keys Hayes (KH)
KH: How does a young girl get a job with delta airlines in 1945?
DH: My uncle, he said what would you really like to do, Dot? I think I’d like to work for the airlines. He said have you applied anywhere? And I said yes, at American. And he said would you be interested in working for Delta? I said I don’t know anything about Delta. And he said it will become one of the best airlines in the world. Go home and write for an application, and i did. They sent me an application, and I filled it out and mailed it back, and I had a special delivery from them, wondering if I could come for an interview.
KH: Did they have appearance standards?
DH: Oh yeah, you had to have short hair for one thing, and you had to be well groomed, in fact Mr. Sut used to check your stockings to see that the seams were straight.
KH: That must have been an interesting job.
DH: Yes, he was very nice (laughs). First flight I had was an early morning flight. This friend of mine said go up in the cockpit and see the takeoff. And I did, and it was the most beautiful thing in the world to see the sun rising. I loved it. I knew then I had the right job. I still, every time a plane goes over, I wish I was on it going somewhere.
KH: Why did you leave?
DH: To get married. then, you couldn’t get married and fly. I hadn’t thought much about being a housewife, and a mother to tell you the truth, but i wouldn’t take a million dollars for any of you. Wouldn’t give you a nickel for another one, but for all four of you, i sure am proud of all of you.
