Danette Banks (DB) and Hasiyna Price (HP)
HP: I have like a bump on my back, and my spine is twisted. My arms are a little too long for my body. Like one is longer than the other. But I don’t care what anybody say, like, now I don’t care. Usually they go around and say–
DB: Humpty Dumpty can’t move and stuff like that.
HP: Yeah.
DB: I knew that used to upset you because you would start crying and go in the house. But I think you’re very pretty.
HP: I don’t care what they think.
DB: Why do you go in the house? Because you just showing them what’s getting to you. They’ll keep doing it constantly because they know it’s getting to you.
HP: They don’t do it now because I don’t let people talk about me no more. I just say ’you call me hunchback, but I’m the flyest hunchback you know’. If you bother me I’m going fight you no matter whether I know you or not.
Is there anything about me you wanted to know, but never asked me?
DB: Yes. Why don’t you talk to the boys who want to talk to you? Why don’t you like them?
HP: I don’t want them to find out about my back and then break up with me because of that.
DB: So? Your back is something you were born with. It don’t mean anything wrong with you.
How would you like to be remembered?
HP: As the sweetest girl–If you don’t get on my bad side.
DB: (Laughter) You are a crazy little girl…
