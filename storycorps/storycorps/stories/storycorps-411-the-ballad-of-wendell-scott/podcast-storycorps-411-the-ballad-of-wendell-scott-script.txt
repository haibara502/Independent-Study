Scott started racing in 1952 toward the end of the Jim Crow era, and was the first African American to win at NASCAR’s elite major league level. Scott’s family served as his racing team. They traveled to speedways together from their home in Danville, Virginia, and his sons worked as his pit crew. Wendell Scott died in 1990. One of his sons, Frank, and his grandson Warrick, sat down to remember him for StoryCorps.
