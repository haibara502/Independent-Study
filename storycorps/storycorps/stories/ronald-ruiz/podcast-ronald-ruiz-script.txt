RR: I remember one woman in particular, a senior, who had gotten on my bus, and she seemed completely lost. I could see she was confused. I don’t know whether it was an illness, but she looked so beautiful. For a hot summer day to have her fur on… So I said, Are you okay? And she said, I’m fine. I’m fine, but I don’t know what restaurant I’m meeting my friends. I said, You sit on the bus, I’ll run in, and I’ll check each restaurant. The very, very last one on the left, I said, It’s got to be this one.
So I said, Stay here sweetie, it’s nice and cool in here. I went in and said, There’s a lady on the bus, and she’s not sure the restaurant. And I saw a whole bunch of other seniors there and they said, Oh it’s probably her!
So, I ran back to the bus. I said, Sweetie, your restaurant is right here. And I said, No, no, don’t move. And I grabbed her hand. I remember my right hand grabbed her right hand. I wanted to make her feel special, like it’s a limousine it’s a bus.
She said she felt like Cinderella. And she said, I’ve been diagnosed with cancer, and today is the best day of my life. Just because I helped her off the bus. And I never forgot that woman.
