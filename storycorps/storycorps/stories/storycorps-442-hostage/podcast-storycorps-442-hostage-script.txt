In 2003 high school junior Sean Fitzpatrick brought a gun to school. It was Officer John Gately of the Spokane Police Department who negotiated with Sean to bring the situation to an end (they are pictured together at left).Sean recalls: “I remember seeing you and thinking ‘Don’t trust anything he says.’”They reunite for a conversation about the day when their lives intersected and how it changed them both.
