Carolyn Shoemaker (CS) and Phred Salazar (PS):
CS: When I was 50 years old, and my kids were grown, Gene suggested, “Well, maybe I would like to try my hand at astronomy a little bit.”
I’d never stayed awake a whole night in my life.
PS: (laughs)
CS: The idea of going to the telescope seemed kind of impossible.
But I found 32 comets.
And then, Gene and I were on a field trip in Australia. We were rounding a curve, came face-to-face with another vehicle.  It was immediate impact. I couldn’t move and I kept thinking, “Well, Gene will come around in a minute like he always does and he’ll, open the door and get me out of here.”
But he didn’t come.
Gene and I had never talked about what should happen to us when we died, but I was still in the hospital, and here was a phone call from Carolyn Porco.
PS: … one of Dad’s students.
CS: Yes. Carolyn told me that the spacecraft Lunar Prospector was about to go to the Moon.  She hated to bring it up too abruptly, but would I consider having Gene’s ashes go in a capsule on the rocket.
It was an easy decision. He always wanted to be on the Moon. And so I knew that Gene would be just elated if he could go to the Moon … at last.
I miss him every day. But to this day, you know, I look up at the Moon and I can imagine him up there running around looking at craters.
Just knowing his joy in it …
PS: Yeah.
CS: … gave me, still does, a lot of joy.
