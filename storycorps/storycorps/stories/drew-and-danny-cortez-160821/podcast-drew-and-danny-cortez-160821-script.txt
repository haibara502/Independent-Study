Danny Cortez (DC) and Drew Cortez (DrC)
DC: That morning I came to church, my blood pressure was super high. I felt so much stress, and everyone was wondering what’s going on.
<Sermon tape fades in> 
I recently revealed to the elders that I have changed my stance on homosexuality…
DC: But I remember as I was speaking, I felt empowered like I hadn’t felt in such a long time. I knew that what I was sharing that Sunday was important. 
I was driving my son Drew to school, and he turned over to me and he says, “Dad, I’m gay.” I remember I just turned around and I hugged him so hard. And I said, “I love you so much, son.
What was going through your mind when I was giving my sermon? 
DrC: I felt vulnerable, and I just remember thinking what was going to happen after this.  This is our life now.
And so when I was asked a question recently, ‘How does it feel to know that you might be terminated in a few weeks. I said I’m at peace. I’m at peace because I know my heart has been enlarged.’   
DC: When I sat down, I felt like this weight had just been lifted out of me, and people knew where we stood. At the same time, I know Drew your struggle has been even more difficult than mine. 
Did you ever feel like you were the problem?
DrC: All the time.
DC: What stands out to you?
DrC: Probably my name and the word abomination used in the same sentence.
DC: As a father it was so difficult to hear that because we felt like they didn’t know our son. So there’s part of me that says yes I want to love people that disagree with me who disagree with us. But the other part of me now is asking but how can I do it in way that honors you.  
I know that whatever happens, compassion is giving me clarity. It’s giving me clarity in my purpose. And I pray that our church will survive this.
