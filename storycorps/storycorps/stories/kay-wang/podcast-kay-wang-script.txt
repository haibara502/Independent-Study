Kay Wang (KW) and Chen Wang (CW) and Cheng Wang (CgW)
KW: I wasn’t very nice. If I make a mistake my mother, she make me apologize. In our custom, when you apologize to your mother, you have to bring a cup of tea and say, ‘I’m sorry.’ But I purposely dropped that hot cup of tea on my mother’s lap. [Laughter] And I wasn’t a good student. I always lie to get out of school because lots of boyfriend after me. [Laughter] That time I was still young. I was not bad looking then. So what else? Hurry, hurry. I want to go home.
CW: How’d you meet Grandpa?
KW: I was a training nurse in a hospital. He was there for hemorrhoid operation. So when your grandpa see me, your grandpa keep on asking me to get married. And I said, ‘I don’t like you. You have bald headed.’ [Laughter] I didn’t like him because he’s ugly. But one thing about your grandpa—he’s very smart. That’s it. No more question!
CgW: Just a couple more questions?
KW: Short one.
CgW: Short ones.
CW: Short ones. Tell me about working at Bloomingdales. What did you do?
KW: You know what I do. I’m not going to tell you.
CW: No you have—you have to talk about it.
KW: I am a detective. I got the very famous designer. I better not mention her name. She stole a dress three thousand-some dollar. So I walk out the store. I say, ‘Would you like to pay me that dress?’ She said, ‘Do you know who I am?’ I said, ‘Yeah, you’re a thief.’ [Laughter] So, that’s my life.
CW: Do you have any regrets?
KW: No! What should I regret? No. I think I’m old enough to do whatever I would like. And… that’s it. [Laughter]
