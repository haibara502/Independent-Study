(Ambient pool hall sounds.)
ALAN LOMAX:: What’s your name?
WILLIAM CLARK:: My name is William Clark.
LOMAX:: How old are you.
CLARK:: I am 16 years old.
LOMAX:: Well, tell me about when you first heard about this war, and what you thought when you first heard it.
CLARK:: When I first heard about the war, I said to myself: I hope the United States will fight until the last man go down, and. . .in God the Negroes trust. Although many Negro lives will be lost in the war, as was before, I hope the Negro will have  freedom than they have now.much more
LOMAX:: Tell me what your feeling about this war with Japan is.
WILLIAM KEITH:: I say as far as my concern, this country is involved in war, and I think we should be patriotic regardless of creed, color, and condition. I will say, furthermore, I will say that I believe it is a stab in the back, and I hope that this country will wipe her off the face of the world. That’s as much as I have to say about that.
Well this name is Keith, William H. Keith. My occupation is bricklaying for the last 37 years. I don’t believe in Nazism at all. I believe that Adolf Hitler despises every black face that the world has ever known. He is really an enemy to the Negro. That’s my thought about it. And as farthe Jews and the Negroes, they don’t mean nothing in Hitler’s sight. He doesn’t think anything about them. He thinks they’re nothing but a bunch of bums. That’s all to him. And if he had his way with the Negro people of America, I believe he’d come here and annihilate the whole bunch.
