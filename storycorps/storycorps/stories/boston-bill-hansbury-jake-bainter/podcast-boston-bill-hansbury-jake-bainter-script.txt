Jake Bainter (JB): ”Boston” Bill, tell me about the day that we met.
”Boston” Bill Hansbury (BBH): Well that day, I had just regained the ability to ride my bike. And here I am, coming up to a stop sign. I don’t know what happened but I could not get my feet out of the pedals. So I took the bicycle over to the curb, and that’s when the car pulled up.
JB: That was four hours before my amputation. We were driving to the hospital and we saw on the side of the road, a guy with a prosthetic leg. And I remember pulling around up to the curb and meeting you.
BBH: Your mother and father got out. They introduced me to you and explained the situation about what you had gone through, the countless surgeries. And we talked. I remember saying that if I could do it at my age—and I was 70, and you were seven—you were going to do this so fast and so well. And I was trying to give you some hope, because I knew what was coming, having been there. And when we parted, all I could think about was where you were going. And how brave you were in doing it.
JB: Thank you. That day that we met, that will always be implanted in my mind.
BBH: Yeah, I know what you mean. A lot of people think miracles are big things. And they are big things. But they can have very, very small beginnings.
