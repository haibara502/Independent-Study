LW: Who is important in your life right now?
TW: My mother. Because my mother was the one that raised me. We went through so many things together. When I was little we didn’t have that much money and whatever money we had, my father would take the money and go buy drugs or something like that. And my mother would have to hop the turnstill to go to work and she wouldn’t have no money to get back.
LW: Did you get angry at your dad for being addicted to drugs?
TW: I never knew him. He left when I was like one.
LW: Knew anything good about him?
TW: No, the only good thing I heard about him was, he came to; I think it was my second birthday party. And after that I have never seen him again.
LW: What is your father’s name?
TW: I don’t know.
LW: Wow, do you ever think you want to ask your mom?
TW: I don’t know if I should. I don’t like to bring back memories in her past because she’s doing so much better now.
LW: So all you know is his last name is Williams.
TW: Yeah, and I’m the only Williams in the family. Sometimes I’m curious, if he does wonder what I’m doing where I am. Sometimes I wonder if he’s alive or even dead. Some people when they get old they never know their birth fathers. They look for them. I don’t know if I’d be able to get up the strength to really get out there and find him cause if I really do find him I don’t know what I would do. Say, ’hi, I’m your daughter and then what.”
