		In this episode, we listen to three interviews recorded over the course of a decade that trace the journey of a young man with Asperger’s Syndrome from middle school through college and into the working world.At the time of their interview, Josh was an honors student who was having a tough time socially. Josh has Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of autism that makes it hard to read body language and other social cues. Sarah described it as being “born without social genes.” Their conversation and the positive response to it helped Josh manage a rough period of his life.Then, in 2011, Sarah reached out to let us know that Josh, who was a freshman in college, was deeply depressed. She proposed having a second interview to try to get him to talk to her about it. At the end of that conversation, it didn’t seem as though Josh would make it through his first semester.But in June 2017, just two weeks after his graduation ceremony, Josh and Sarah sat down for a third interview in which they reflect on the past decade and look toward the future.
