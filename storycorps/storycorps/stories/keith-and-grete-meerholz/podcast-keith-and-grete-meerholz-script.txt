Grete Meerholz (GM) and Keith Meerholz (KM)
GM: Someone came in and–into the room, and said um, that the tower had fallen. And um, and I thought that was it. I kinda gave up hope.
KM: Fortunately I didn’t wait too long to call her.
GM: Shortly after, you called, and I picked up the phone and you just said, ”Grete, I’m alive!” And I started screaming so that everybody in the house would know.
KM: I don’t even remember what I said, to be honest.
GM: I do. You said, ”I made it out, and I have some burns, but I’m–I’m gonna get away.” And I just remember screaming, ”Just get away, get away, get away.” I knew you’d make it.
KM: How do you think you’ve changed?
GM: How do I think I’ve changed?
KM: Yeah.
GM: I guess I’m not really sure. I do know that every time I–I get mad at you or I’m–we have an argument, I can think back to September 11th and I can kind of forgive you for anything. Um, and I love you because you make me laugh, even though I always say I’m funnier.
KM: No way, I’m definitely funnier.
GM: You make me laugh. And um, you’re my best friend.
KM: Yeah.
GM: And it’s nice to have a best friend to go through life with.
