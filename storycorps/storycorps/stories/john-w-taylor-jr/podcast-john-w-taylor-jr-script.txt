It wasn’t that bad until I actually slept a week in my truck in my backyard, no people, sounds of rats running everywhere, just looked like chemical warfare. Before it happened, you walked around the corner to the drug store, you walked to the neighborhood store and the neighborhood wino ask you for a quarter, like he ask you everyday, you don’t think those sort of things are important, until they’re not there. I’m trying to decide whether I stay in New Orleans, or leave New Orleans. I mean I’ve lived all of the United States and came back here.
This was the Home Port, as we called it, now, no more home. And a lot of people are not coming back because they don’t want to feel this way again, you know it’s just, it’s too hard to see it this way. I don’t know if it’s that I feel everything I love is gone, or what, I’m just not happy here anymore.
