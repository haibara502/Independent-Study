Mytokia Fair (MF) and Thomas Fair (TF)
MF: The night before, something had upset him. And it got to a point where he was hitting me, I mean repeatedly, and he spat in my face. And then the next day, I looked at him and, you know, I just saw that look. I knew that it was going to start all over again. I couldn’t take it anymore, I just wanted the pain to stop. And, I shot and killed him.
When the police officers got there, I, I was frantic trying to tell them, explain to them what had happened. That’s when I realized I was going to jail, was when, when they put handcuffs on me and read me my rights.
TF: Was there any time in that relationship that you could get out of it.
MF: Oh, no. I knew he would follow me. Oh I knew that. And, I thought I could change someone. I couldn’t change anyone, but myself.
TF: When you got out of prison, was there any fears of how you’re going to start your life over.
MF: Oh my god, yes, plenty of fears. I was devastated that I’m not a police officer anymore, and I lost that. But I understood what I did, I broke the law. So in breaking the law there’s consequences. So, and when I came out, I had to come out running. Had to rebuild my mind like a muscle, like your weights, like your exercise, to know how worthy that I am. That’s why I was able to allow you to come into my life.
TF: You know, I knew you’d been hurt. And, um, I wanted to be a man that you could trust.
MF: I wasn’t worried. I saw that wouldn’t hurt me. And you told me that you loved me, and I believed you.
TF: I see you as a very powerful, beautiful woman. And I wish the men before me could have seen this.
MF: Well my life is far different now. And I’m so excited of what’s to come.
