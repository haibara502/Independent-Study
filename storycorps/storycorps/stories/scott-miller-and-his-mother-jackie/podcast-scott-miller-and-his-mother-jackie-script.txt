Scott Miller (SM) and Jackie Miller (JM)
SM: When did you and dad decide to adopt?
JM: We always knew from the time we first married and we must have talked about it even before that. You know, we are very methodical people.
SM: [laughs]
JM: Now, this is something you don’t know. When I was seventeen, I got pregnant. And the light of my life is my father but he gave me 24 hours to leave town. And, I did have a son. I gave this baby up for adoption and said at that time that I will adopt a child when I’m able to take care of a child.
SM: Wow. I just wasn’t ready for that.
JM: I’m sure.
SM: Thank you for telling me.
JM: So many times I would think, ’Gosh, is this the time to tell him?’ But I’m 73 now and it just seems like such a big secret.
SM: Well, I guess, um, speaking of secrets. Um, when I came out, I remember kind of saying to you, ’Hey Mom, I want to talk to you about something’ and I stumbled just telling you I was gay. The first thing out of your mouth was, ’I love you and I’m your mother.’
JM: By that time I knew. There wasn’t even any question in my mind. You know, just as you were this wonderful little kid with curiosity and couldn’t speak well you–[laughs]
SM: [laughs]
JM: –You know, that was as much a part of you as any of the other things. It’s just…You! And I couldn’t be happier if you’re happy with your life. Plus, you help me with my hair sometimes…
SM: [laughs]
JM: [laughs]
SM: Yeah, it comes with its perks.
JM: There’s no downside for me.
SM: It’s kind of funny, I think of myself to be an emotional person but where you’re concerned, I try not to be very emotional and I worry that you’ll never know just how deeply I love you and how scary it is for me sometimes to imagine life without you.
JM: That’s something I can’t make better for you. I don’t doubt it’ll be tough but…you’ll be okay. The thing that’s been wonderful, sweetheart, is that we haven’t missed much, you know? We spend a lot of time together and you’ll have those memories.
