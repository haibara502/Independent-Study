Marcia Sutton (MS) and Sandra Sowder (SS)
MS: I was the preacher’s wife. We had been in the same little church for 20 years. I had watched people marry, people die, people give birth. When we knew we were going to divorce, and things were going to change, it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but it was such a relief because I really wanted to be with you. The church, um, publicly withdrew fellowship from me. And you went to church with me that day. Do you remember that?
SS: Oh my goodness. They read a letter, and turned you over to the devil, is part of the wording in the letter.
MS: Yes.
SS: Your children were actually there, and watched these people that you had loved, go up and sign this letter, along with their father. It was like the Salem Witch Hunt or something.
MS: I think I felt like over time, my four daughters would understand me.
SS: You had a, a very very close relationship with all of your girls.
MS: I did go by to see one of my older daughters, ‘cause she’s pregnant and just say hello and I love you. And her husband called the police, and asked me to leave. I remember the police officer that told me I was gonna have to leave he, he apologized, and said, “Ma’am, I’m very sorry for your pain.” They think what they’re doing’s right. If I didn’t believe that they thought it was the right thing I’m sure I would lose my mind. I remember you used to say when we get old, you would help me walk along, ‘cause I’m a little older than you and I have a bad back. And we’re going to build that house on a bluff, and if children and grandchildren want to come be a part of that, they’re welcome.
SS: They would be so loved. It would just be great.
MS: It makes it hard for us to have the storybook ending that we want. But I’m still not sorry that I found you. I wouldn’t change it.
SS: I agree.
