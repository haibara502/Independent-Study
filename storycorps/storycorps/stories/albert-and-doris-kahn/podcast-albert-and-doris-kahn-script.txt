Albert Kahn (AK) and Doris Kahn (DK)
AK: It was the greatest thing because we had Luna Park and Steeple Chase and especially the movie houses because the movie houses are not like today. You went into the movies, you sat down, a waiter came over and asked you what you would like to eat. And you could buy a piece of pie or a frankfurter or have a drink, a glass of soda, for ten cents and then the movies came on. It was just the greatest place to be. And if the world today would be like Coney Island was at that time there would be no trouble. It would be a marvelous thing.
