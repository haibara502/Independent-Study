But, your grandpa passed away when I was thirteen. So that meant that Grandma had to raise five kids on her own, paying the mortgage by herself. And, I loved my room. And I had a nice full sized bed, and my pink cover and my dust ruffles.ABC: I remember watching my dad paint the walls. And just thinking, “This house is so huge!” 
But I remember, I came home one day and my bed was gone. And so when my mom got home, you know I kind of gave her a little bit of attitude, I, “Where’s my bed?!” And she says, “Oh Alicia, a family came from Mexico and they had nothing.” And I’m all, “You know mom, that’s not my problem.” And she says, “It’s not your problem?” And I said, “No!” And she says, “Follow me.”
She took me to the kitchen, she gave me some grocery bags.  We started clearing out the cupboards; cans of peas, cans of corn. And I was puttin’ ‘em in the bag and I said, “What are we doing?” And she says, “Be quiet, and fill the bags.” So I kept filling the bag. We got in the car, and she took me to the house where my bed was. And it was a family of seven, and the woman had just had a baby. So she was in bed surrounded by her kids. And it was all a one room house, and a dirt floor. I walked out of there crying. Because I was ashamed. Because I didn’t realize just how much Grandma gave us.nAnd these parents, just want food, and they’re the people that keep this whole area going because they’re the farmworkers. And so I just felt … felt like such an ungrateful kid. 
You know, she had high standards in herself.  And I cannot think of anybody more wise than Grandma.
