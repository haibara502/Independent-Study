Grandma had a routine. On Monday she did laundry. Tuesday and Wednesday was ironing. Thursday she went to Fordham to pay the bills and Friday was shopping day — the meat from Frank the butcher. Olive oil – that was delivered. Also the bleach water for the laundry was delivered. Saturday was cleaning day dusting, vacuuming, polishing the furniture. And while grandma and I did that together, we listened to the make believe ballroom on the radio. It’s the make believe ballroom time (sings). And they would have a countdown of the top 50 so we started cleaning at number 50, and by the time it got to number one, the house was clean.
