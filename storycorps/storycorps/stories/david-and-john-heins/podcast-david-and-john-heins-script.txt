John Heins (JH) and David Heins (DH)
DH: When I was a kid I used to tell all of the other kids that I knew that you were the smartest man in the world. And I still think that you’re the most intelligent person that I know. Do you have any advice for me on being a father?
JH: I think what I see so far, you really, man you’re a whiz at changing diapers. That’s much better than I was, and …I’d say, um, just try to be yourself, and be fair and be honest. What’s been the most exciting thing for you about having a child?
DH: The first thing that happened is that I all of a sudden understood how much you love me. I never got it before. I mean I knew you guys loved me –
JH: You’re gonna make me cry!
DH: Just to finally realize how much sacrifice, and how you guys would do anything. And to all of a sudden know the depth of love that you have for me and that I have for this guy and just to watch him laugh. I mean, it’s incredible… I can see you in his face, you know.. and I can see all of our ancestors, you know — when I watch him laugh. It’s just better than any other experience.
JH: I know, I know what you mean. That’s how I felt too when you came along. You and Natalie have been the great joys of my life… And now these grandchildren.
DH: Well, thank you very much Daddy, I love you so much. And I want you to know that you’re a successful father and you’re really a great role model for me. I’m really glad you came all the way down here to do this with me.
JH: Well, I love you too. And as long as you have a little fellow named Conrad that’s bait enough right there to get me to come any time.
