BC: I went a couple of steps and hit something. And I told the fire chief that someone was on the floor. And he put the light on him and I remember him saying, ”Oh my god, it’s Father Mike.”
He checked his vital signs and he said, ”He’s dead.”
So, we all picked him up. We went up the steps. And I remember looking up because one of the firemen was yelling at a photographer. He was telling him in no uncertain terms, get out of the way. I didn’t even think about that picture being taken. I was just doing my job. It’s just… so many other heroic acts were being done all around me. It’s just that no one took a picture of it. The next day, when I came back into the precinct, somebody showed me the picture. And uh I got a lot of calls from people that knew Mychal Judge, firemen. They assumed I knew him, you know, but I didn’t until that day.
He’s always been on my mind ever since then because it’s my firm belief that the only reason I’m here today is because of him. I know that sounds weird, but everybody you see in that picture was saved. And uh, I’m sure had he not been there, I would have been trying to look for other people, and when that North Tower fell, I would have been right in the middle of it just like the rest of the firemen were and some of my cops. But nothing was going to happen that day. At least not to me.
