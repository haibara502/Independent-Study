Jerry Tierstein (JT): A lady puts a cat in my cab, and it’s rush hour, and then se says, ”oh I forgot my portfolio, I’ve gotta go up and get it. So just drive the cat around the block or so and come around.” So she slammed the door and she left. Now I’m sitting there with the cat in the backseat. So I say ”okay, frick it, I’ll drive around the block,” what am I going to do? So as I reach the first corner there’s a light. Somebody’s running over to the cab. I say, ”woah, you can’t get in, I got somebody.” ”I don’t see anybody in there.” (customer) So he opens the door and he goes, ”ohh”, and jumps back, he goes. ”why didn’t you tell me you’ve got a cat?”, ”I said I got somebody, you know, it ain’t human, so i don’t know what to say”.

JT: What would I do differently? I don’t think I could have done better than being a cab driver.

That floor would shine, you could eat off it. And being I’m a cab driver, I want to be the best in the business, and I think I am one of the best in the business, because I really do the job the way it should be done, the old fashion way.
