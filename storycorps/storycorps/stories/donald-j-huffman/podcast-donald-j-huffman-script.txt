Donald J. Huffman (DH)
DH: I am Donald Huffman. I grew up in Bathe, Michigan. It was a little farm town, had an elevator, a little drug store. And, you knew everybody within twenty miles. Back then, that’s the way it was. I went to the, uh, consolidated school. That’s the one that, that the janitor blew up.
I was nine-years-old. I lost one eye, lost part of my cheek bone, broken wrist, compound fracture, that’s where they had to have plates put in. And lots of scares, lots of scares all over; I was just messed up. There were three kids, three out of the same family. They were killed right there. Everybody was hard hit. Everybody.
