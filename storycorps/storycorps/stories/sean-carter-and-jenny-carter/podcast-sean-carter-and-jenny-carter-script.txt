Sean Carter (SC) and Jenny Carter (JC)
SC: Hi my name is Sean Carter. I am 31 years old. I am here with my mom Jenny Carter. What were you feeling when you found out I had been in a car wreck?
JC: I was devastated. I don’t think I ever understood how bad a brain injury could be. It was just so hard seeing your child’s lifeless body in a bed for so long. You couldn’t do anything for two years. But I think you know we’ve accomplished quite a bit together in the last 10 years.
SC: I”m certainly not ready to do everything alone, but I do so much for myself now.
JC: It’s kind of hard living with your mom twenty-four seven when you’re 32 years old.
SC: Hell yeah!
JC: What’s been the hardest moment for you?
SC: I’m not sure I could even choose one particular thing. I certainly miss having friends. I miss being in love. I would be willing to bet I would have been married by now with kids like my two brothers have.
JC: As your mom Sean that’s probably one of the hardest things for me. The pain that I have because it hasn’t happened for you. If this was to be our last conversation what would you say to me?
SC: Let me stop you right there. I know you will be here for many years to come. But I want you to know how thankful I am for what you have done for me. You gave up your life to give me a life.
JC: Yeah. But it’s ok. Time’s really the valuable commodity that we have, and if you can share time with somebody else that’s probably the most important thing you can do for someone. It’s the only thing that matters.
SC: I don’t say this enough. I admire your commitment to be the best damn mom you can be, and you do a damn fine job. I love you beyond the moon and back.
JC: Thank you son.
