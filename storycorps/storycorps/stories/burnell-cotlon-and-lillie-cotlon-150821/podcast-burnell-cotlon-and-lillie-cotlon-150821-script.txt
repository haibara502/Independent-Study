Burnell Cotlon (BC) and Lillie Cotlon (LC)
BC: I remember coming back home, that was the first time I cried.
LC: We lost everything.
BC: Yup. I was in that FEMA trailer for almost three years. And I drove around the Ninth Ward. We didn’t have no stores, no barber shops, no laundry rooms.
LC: THere’s no where for people to go buy a loaf of bread.
BC: Right, you have to catch three buses to get to a store. And I always was taught if there’s a problem, somebody’s got to make a move. So I decided to open up a grocery store. I remember when I first bought the building, everybody thought that I was crazy.
LC: When I peaked in the door before you started working, I said, “This is nothing but junk!” I mean, it was trash and debris on the floor that you had to crawl over and, “How can he make anything out of this?” But you were one of my very interesting sons, always jumping into things you had no business doing. <<Laughter>>
BC: It was hard, it was real, real hard. And those 8-hour days turned into 14, 15 hours a day. But what motivated me the most was seeing the people that was walking by with the groceries and seeing them get off the bus with all of those bags. That made me work harder. We finally did the ribbon cutting ceremony and that day I will never forget, you served the very first…
LC: Sno-ball.
BC: Sno-ball. And the very first customer cried ‘cuz she said she never thought the Lower Ninth Ward was coming back.
LC: You saw something that I didn’t see. I’m glad you, you took the chance.
BC: Just seeing so many people, the look on their faces, it’s a joy. It’s a headache back then but now it’s worth it.
LC: It’s all worth it.
BC: It was all worth it. And if it take me doing it by myself I’m a put one business at a time back into the Lower Ninth Ward. ‘Cuz it’s home.
