Lauren Woo (LW), Dae Jin Ryook (DR) and Kyung Woo Ryook (KR)
LW: What do you miss most about Sunga?
DR: Her big smile. And, uh, she loved to call three to four times a week. ”Hi Daddy.” In Korean, ”Hi Ahpah.” ”How are you doing?” ”Did you have dinner?”
LW: Did that make you smile?
DR: Of course. I miss that. I miss that. Maybe if she’s alive right now she could get married, she got some baby, but that’s not possible. It’s not gonna happen to me.
LW: If you could talk to Sunga right now, what would you want to say?
DR: I’m sorry and I love you. Because, I never said I’m sorry to my daughter. I never said I love you to my daughter. I was kind of tough father to Sunga.
LW: You wanted her to be tough.
DR: Uh-huh. But even though I didn’t say that kind of words, probably she knows it.
LW: Oh, she knows that…
DR: Probably she knows.
LW: She knows it. I know that. How are you different now than you were before you lost Sunga?
DR: Sunga was an only child. That means only me and my wife has to live on. When we go to bed–
LW: Yeah…
DR:–that time is kind of pretty lonely and sad. We just sit on couch, watch the TV, 12 o’clock, 1 o’clock, 2 o’clock, sometimes 3 o’clock in the morning. We don’t have any, uh, desire to work or desire to eat, desire to sleep. Nothing. After we lost our daughter, we lost everything.
