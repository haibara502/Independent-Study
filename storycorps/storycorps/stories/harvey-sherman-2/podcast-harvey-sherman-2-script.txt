HS: In 1951, we blew a thirteen and a half game lead and we had the playoff against the Giants. I think a guy by the name of Thomson hit a home run off a guy by the name of Branca. Still hurts to talk about it. Many of our fathers were Giant fans but all of the sons and daughters were Dodger fans because Ebbets Field was a neighborhood place. Those were the days where baseball was during the day. So in 1951 when Thomson hit the home run, my pals and I were in school. The teacher, Mrs. McPherson, lovely old Irish lady, stopped teaching. ”Put your radios on. Let’s listen to the Dodger game.”

HS: And that’s what happened in the whole high school. Everybody had a portable radio and we all listened to the game, including the teachers.

HS: Well my friend Bobby had his maroon portable radio on. And again, we didn’t have a lot of money in those days. But when he hit the home run, class was dismissed. Bobby took his radio and he threw it down the staircase. How can you forget it. Sort of like Pearl Harbor and stuff like that. We remember it very, very well.
