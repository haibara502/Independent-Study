Ed Roy and Mary Johnson-Roy
Mary Johnson-Roy (MJR): How did you and I meet?
Ed Roy (ER): We met when my first-born and my one and only son was murdered. And a couple of my daughters had asked me to go to the church to hear you speak. I wasn’t ready for the forgiveness part, but I was at a loss. Like I shared with you, I thought God took my boy and was punishing me for my own crimes. I had joined the gangs early and pulled my first armed robbery at 11 years old. But with you being there, I saw hope. You took me under your wing; that’s why I called you my angel.
Then, I remember, I had that dream — that was just before our wedding. And your son was saying, ”Yeah, Mom! Alright!” You know, ”Right on!” And my son was saying, ”Yeah, Dad! ‘Bout time you got it right!”
[Laughter]
MJR: We also had Oshea in our wedding because he is my spiritual son.
ER: That was beautiful. As the years and time goes by, you know where I been. You know where I hurt.
MJR: And I know you take care of me when I’m not doing well. And I’m grateful to have someone there that has experienced the same thing that I have. The anniversary’s coming up of my son’s murder — February 12th.
ER: That empty hole’s always going to be there in our hearts. But I feel like when we together and we able to listen to one another’s heartbeats, it says a lot.
MJR: I’m thankful. I really am. You’re a good man.
