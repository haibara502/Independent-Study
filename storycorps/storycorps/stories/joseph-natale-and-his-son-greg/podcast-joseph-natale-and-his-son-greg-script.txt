Joseph Natale (JN) and Greg Natale (GN)
Joseph Natale: I spent a couple of years overcompensating as a father. You know I’d open the refrigerator door and see two gallons of milk, and I’d have to run to the store because we were running short of milk. And buy three more gallons. It was that kind of thing. I was so afraid of not being a good parent and filling in for the missing mother. I did that for a couple of years. I realized that I needed to start doing something for myself as well as my kids. And I began to participate in local theater.
