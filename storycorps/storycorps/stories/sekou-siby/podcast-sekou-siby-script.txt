 
Sekou Siby (SS)
SS: I was a prep cook, so for eight hours peeling potatoes and cleaning onions.  And uh, when Moises Rivas was hired I was assigned to train him. We had a strong relationship because I was directing his work.  On September 8, Moises Rivas asked me, ‘Do you mind working for me on Sunday, and uh, I’ll pick up your shift on Tuesday.’  So he ended up working September 11. And uh, he did not make it.  He has two kids. You know, losing one person in your life is traumatic but I lost a lot of people. And uh, what I compare it to is the experience of a soldier without being a soldier. Because a soldier is trained to lose massive amount of people. And uh, we were just kitchen workers. So after 9/11, I did cab driving for almost a year and a half. You know, take this person point A and I drop you point B, let’s not make friends. Because I felt if like if I had to lose another close friend of mine, I don’t think I would be able to recoup from it.  The feeling of, ‘Why Moises, why not me?’ is something that will travel in me my entire life. He went to work and never made it home.
