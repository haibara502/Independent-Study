John Curtis (JC) and John Wikiera (JW)
JC: So, what are some of your dreams?
JW: Well, I kind of want to go to Mars.
JC: Really?
JW: And be an astronaut.
JC: What do you think it’s going to be like on Mars?
JW: Red…
JC: Hmm?
JW: Yeah.
JC: If you don’t go to Mars, what else do you think you might want to do?
JW: Maybe a video game tester.
JC: A video game tester.
JW: Even though a video game tester might be very… exclusive.
JC: It might be tough. I don’t know how many of those job positions there are.
JW: So, do you remember what was going through your head when you first saw me?
JC: I thought you were so… can I say beautiful, or do I have to say handsome?
JW: Doesn’t matter.
JC: Well you were both. I had always wanted to be a parent. So it was a dream I had but I never dreamed would come true. Because Papa and I are gay, but we had some friends who started thinking about adoption and that got us thinking. So, we started into the process. And one day, a FedEx truck came down the driveway. And they …they had a little picture of you, and I knew that I was going to get to be your dad. And it was wonderful. And the first time I ever got to hold you, when I got to feed you your first bottle, I guess in a way I was concerned that you might be scared or nervous with these new people. But, holding you up against my chest—it was just like you fit. Like we fit. JC: How has being a parent changed you?
JC: Oh, it changes everything. Do you think about having a family of your own?
JW: Yeah, sometimes. And like when I have kids, you will get to meet them.
JC: That’s my dream too. I love you very much.
JW: I love you too.
JC: We were always meant to be together.
