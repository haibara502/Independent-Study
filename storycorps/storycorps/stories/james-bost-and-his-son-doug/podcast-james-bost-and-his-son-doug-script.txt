James Bost (JB) and Doug Bost (DB)
JB: When I was 9 years old, and that was about 1932, my dad was working 24/7 to make it. There were seven truck salesmen within my father’s area or domain. And six of them we fired. There was only one left, and that was my father. And he busted himself to keep that job. And, that brought on a heart attack. He recovered and, uh, did something that still sticks with me. He went into the bank, and he said, ’I want to withdraw my money.’ And, the teller gave him a hard time. They had windows with, uh, big iron bars, vertical bars. And my dad was, uh, he had a temper, he got so agitated and he took a hold of the bars. And he scared the teller, no question about it. And the teller brought his money to him. He put into a suitcase and he went into the backyard of the house where we lived. He dug a large hole about four feet deep and buried that suitcase. No one knew anything about it except the family. He didn’t trust the banks for a long time. And, this made an impression on me to the point that in the last year, I went to the local bank, where I’ve been doing business, and I withdrew several thousand dollars.
DB: Did you dig a hole and put in the garden?
JB: No I didn’t do that. I have it, uh, in a undisclosed location. I don’t have a lot of money, but at least I know that it there was a crash right now, I’d have X amount of dollars to deal for the next month or two. And I wouldn’t have to worry. I think it’s kind of silly in some ways, and kind of stupid, but at the same time, the Great Depression made a, a impact on me, and I can’t forget it.
