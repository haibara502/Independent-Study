Roberta Keys Torn (RKT) and Susan Young (SY)
RKT: It was in the middle of the night and I guess word got out in a hurry because everybody in the town was excited and there were some women, they opened up the dry goods store, and got us some little clothes to put on because my mother was only prepared for one and we only have one birth certificate for four babies so all it has our names all on one line and then it says ”all girls.” From the time we were very young, I think nine months old, we were on display at the Oklahoma State Fair. Every year until we were in the third grade, they built a kind of a little house for us with a tall wall, and then people spent 25 cents to come in and look over the wall. We just were on our regular little routine; we played with dolls and they handed out little postcards with our pictures, and later on when we were growing up, some people would say, ’Oh, we paid 25 cents to see you when you were little at the fair.” And we’d say, ”You want your money back?”
SY: Did they?
RKT: No, they were afraid to say.
SY: Well, I know too that you had chances to go into show business once college was over. What happened?
RKT: Well, everybody else was making money so we had to think of a way so we devised a little act where we sang and played our saxophones and told the little stories of our lives.
SY: What broke up that act?
RKT: Well, Mona announced that she was going to get married. Everybody thought it was wonderful, that it had to be, but I was sad. I liked being a quadruplet — there never was anything else.
