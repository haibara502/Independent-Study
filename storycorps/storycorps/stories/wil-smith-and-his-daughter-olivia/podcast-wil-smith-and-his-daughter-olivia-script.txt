Wil Smith (WS) and Olivia Smith (OS)
WS: I wasn’t planning on having you as my roommate. I actually thought that if Bowdoin College knew I had you they wouldn’t let me come to college.  So, I hadn’t mentioned it to anyone. And, I got a job at Staples, cleaning at night. And I had to take you in with me at work sometimes and hide you in the closet. [Laughs]
I think I lost something like 27 pounds, just from stress, and not eating, because I didn’t have enough for both of us. My basketball teammates were my first babysitters.  I just remember coming from class and there were four giant guys and then there was this 18-month-old who was tearing up the room. [laughs]
OS: Were you ever embarrassed bringing me to class? Or just having me in general?
WS: I felt a little awkward, but never embarrassed. There were times when the only way I could get through was to come in and look at you, and see you sleeping, and then go back to my studies. And my graduation day from Bowdoin is a day I’ll never forget. You know, all of my classmates, they stood up and gave me the only standing ovation.
OS: I remember walking up with you and having my head in your shoulder. [Laughs]
WS: Yeah, the dean called both of our names as he presented us with the diploma.
OS: So, technically I already graduated from college.
WS: Nice try. [Laughs] The degree only has my name on it. So you still got to go.
OS: I really admire your strength. And, I love you.
WS: I draw my strength from you. I always have and I still do.
