Rick Williams (RW) and Jay Hollingsworth (JH)
RW: As a child, he was a happy person and he loved to carve. He was 4 when he’d done his first totem pole.
JH: John was a native carver, and they can carve and walk at the same time. And that day, John was walking with an open pocket knife.
RW: He was carving an eagle at the moment.
JH: You see the dash cam video, and you see the officer he’s already got his weapon out.

He screams ‘Put the knife down.’

JH: A couple of times
But John was deaf in one ear.

RW: 4.7 seconds.
RW: This image I see every day in my sleep. It’s been six years. I walk through depression, suicide thoughts, anger, rage. It’s a side of me that I want to leave alone.

I could hear my grandad’s voice, {native language}, which means ‘can you be a warrior without violence?’  And I didn’t get it until this happened to my brother John. It took me all my life to understand what it meant.
On a weekly basis I go sit at the cemetery and bring a cup a coffee, and share a thought with my brother.
How do I feel?
I’ve asked many times, bring me this policeman, let me share a day with you what it would’ve been like to carve with John. I want them to know him the way I did. He was one of the finest.
