MC: Somehow a friend of ours wanted us to be together in a scene. And we were supposed to meet in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater on 52nd Street and Broadway. Oscar was late. We went to Hector’s.
OC: Hector’s is a restaurant on Broadway.
MC: We sat down and the moment I sat down there was an electricity.
OC: There was magic about me, right? (Laughter)
MC: We never did the scene.
OC: But we got married, which is even better.
MC: He went into the army and he was the only guy that would get three or four letters a day because I wrote to him every single day.
OC: It was a joke in the military. ’Colon! Letter! Colon!’ Everybody’s standing there. Nobody’s getting letters. ’Colon!’ We’re in the middle of the Boondocks.
MC: And we have about 700 letters in a box that one day we’re gonna publish.
OC: We gotta be dead before they’re published. (Laughter) And we’ve been married how long? Let’s see if you remember now.
MC: (Laughs) 43 years we’ve been married and they’ve been the greatest thing in my life because Oscar is a special being. He is a little impatient.
OC: Impetuous.
MC: Impetuous. I call him, uh, Don Fulgencio el hombre que no tuvo infancia.
OC: Never had a youth.
MC: He’s like a baby and that’s what I love about him.
OC: Miriam, you are without doubt a good and giving person, much more giving than I.
MC: No!
OC: No, no, no. You really are.
MC: Oscar, you’ve given me your time, your ears, you always paid attention to the kids. I was always running around doing my acting. You had the patience. You had a special ability that I think I never told you of stopping whatever you were doing. You could have been in a big meeting – who cares – you would stop and listen to me and the kids. A-a-and that’s–
OC: Saintly I would say.
MC: (Laughs) Yes, to marry me you have to be a saint.
