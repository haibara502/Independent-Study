Berryl Anderson (BA) and Virginia Anderson (VA)
BA: I was always pretty smart academically, but my mouth would get me in a lot of trouble. And I found myself in the principal’s office a lot, as you know, because you’d have to come to collect me and to take me home.
VA: yes, I went to the principal’s office so many times for you, you made up for the other three children.
BA: Oh yeah [laughs].
VA: You were always the leader. And when they got in trouble, I knew to call you first, because I knew the works of your hands.
BA: I remember one day in elementary school, Ms. Clayton’s class, I was actually bringing my A-game doing a little bit of stand-up comedy in front of the classroom. And Ms. Clayton just had this look of frustration on her face. She had her hands on her hips, and she wanted me to sit down. She had asked me politely a couple times, but I was on a roll. I mean, I had the class right where I wanted them, in the palm of my hand, and they’re laughing. Then all of a sudden, dead silence. They all look to the right. I was in front of the class so I had to look to my left, and there you were. I was just caught in the act.
VA: Mm hmm (laughs).
BA: And over the years, I’ve always been encouraged by the fact that, on that ride home, whether it was a short ride from elementary school, which was right around the corner, or the ride home from Central High School… you always let me know that I was better than that. And that just being smart wasn’t good enough, that I had to be a good person, and I had to be respectful of other people.
VA: Well, I saw in you, what you didn’t see in yourself. And I knew what you were capable of, and I knew what you could do. I just had to make sure you took the right path, and I’m glad you made it.
BA: You’ve always been there mom, at times when I wanted you there, and at times like in fifth grade when I didn’t want you there. And I’ve always been so grateful for that.
