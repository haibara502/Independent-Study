Mabou Loiseau (MabL) and Mario Loiseau (MarL)
MabL: So Daddy, how did you feel when I was born?
MarL: It was like a dream come true. I wanted a child forever, and you were my first and only born. You know, so, when I went to the nursery to see you, you were sleeping. And then you opened the eyes and look at me. Everyone was amazed. Even the doctor said, ’You see the connection she make with you?’
MabL: Maybe that’s why I love you so much.
MarL: [Laughs]
MabL: But I’ve heard that you cried a lot.
 MarL: Yes, I did. Tears of joy. I was so happy to have you.
MabL: Screaming?
MarL: Screaming, crying. It’s like sunshine comes into our house. It’s so nice to be with you.
You always come up with some new questions. You always—
MabL: —that’s when I’m annoying you. Right?
MarL: Well, not annoying me. It’s like you, you, challenging me.
MabL: But Dad, why do you leave so much instead of staying here with me?  That’s what’s more important!
MarL: Boo-boo, I have to go to work. Daddy works two jobs, so you’re going to have to go to my boss and ask him to give me days off. [Laughs]
MabL: I will!
MarL: Okay, I know you will!
You know, I cannot be home all the time. But if I have enough time I will do four, five, ten, hundred jobs for your education. It’s a joy to do that, knowing that I’m doing that for you. Because I’m so proud to have you as a daughter.
