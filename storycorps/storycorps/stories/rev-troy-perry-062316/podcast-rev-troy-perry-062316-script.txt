TP: When we got to New Orleans, we heard the stories. Buddy Rasmussen, the bartender, got everybody out, and he was the real hero of the fire. But Buddy lost his partner.
I remember going to the hospitals. One of them, school teacher, burned so badly… he said, “Well, the school board just called me to tell me I’m fired from my job.” He’d gotten the phone call while he’s laying in the burn unit. He said, “Can you help me find a job?”
I said, “Absolutely.” He was burnt so bad, I couldn’t imagine him living. I said, “Absolutely. Don’t you worry.” He died the next day.
So I said, “I’m not going anywhere until I hold a service for these people.” But “I’m trying to find a church.” I called denominations and asked them. People laughed in my face, people hung up on me. But somebody said, “There’s a Methodist church here, you may want to talk to.” And so, immediately I called the pastor and he said, “You have my permission.” We had no idea if anybody would show up. But you know something, they did. They completely filled that Methodist church — standing room only.
And then I had to tell them, “There are cameras set up across the street. I’ve just found out. But there’s a way you can get out of here, and that’s to walk down this hallway and there’s a door that’ll take you out into the alley. But nobody left by the backdoor. And that’s the legacy. We never ran away.
