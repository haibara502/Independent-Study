MaCherie Dunbar (MD) and Barb Maglaqui (BM)
MD: I did two back-to-back deployments. I used to do patriot details, which is when a solider or airman or marine or sailor is killed in action. You line up in two columns, up to the back of a C-130. And you give them final salute as they’re loaded onto the plane. Not that many people showed up to do it. The first time I volunteered for one I didn’t really know what it was. I thought maybe it was going to be just one or two coffins. But they just kept coming, one after the other, and then another, and then another. I don’t know how many I sent home. But there was honor in it. Someone had to do it. Someone had to send them home. So I volunteered, almost every time they needed people after that. Even if I’d just come off of a 14 hour shift. But then we’d just move on to the next day. And it was just business as usual.
BM: Do you feel guilty about that?
MD: I guess somewhere deep down I do. Because, I made it back.
