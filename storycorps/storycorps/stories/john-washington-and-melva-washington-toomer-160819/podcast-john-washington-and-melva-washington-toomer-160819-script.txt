John Washington (JW) and Melva Washington Toomer (MWT)
JW: You were my first child, I was so glad you were born. I cannot express the way I feel when I held your sweet little body. I kissed you, I loved you. Oh Melva, I was so proud when I started taking you out with me. You’d take me by the hand, and lead me where you wanted to go.
MWT: (Typing) Do you have any favorite stories about raising us? 
JW: Do you… raising us?
(Laughs) One night I did catch you trying to sneak out.
MWT: (Laughs) We knew our parents couldn’t see, and we used to slip out at night, so Daddy started sleeping in front of the door. 
JW: (Laughs) One story is, I was getting ready to give Warren a bath, but, as I picked him up to put him in the tub, he said, “Daddy, I’ve got my shoes on.” (Laughs)
MWT: (Typing) What were some of your proudest moments?
JW: What are my proudest moments?
Well, I did not graduate from high school. So I began to read books in braille to learn the ways of life. And then I taught people to read braille. So if I could help some person, then my living will not be in vain.
MWT: (Typing) Do you have any questions for me?
JW: Do you have questions…?
MWT: For me? 
JW: Yes, I’m 95, and I might live to be 100, what are you going to do with me?
MWT: I am going to take care of you the best I can.
JW: You’re doing a wonderful job. God bless you.
MWT: Daddy, I thank you for the interview.
JW: Oh, you’re welcome. Thank you Melva.
