Liyna Anwar (LA): I’m Liyna Anwar, one of the producers here at StoryCorps. Today we’ll hear the voice of one of the students killed in Tuesday’s shooting in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Yusor Abu-Salha (YAS): Hey, hello. My name is Yusor Abu-Salha and today I’ll be interviewing my former teacher and principal.
—————
LA: That teacher is Mussarut Jabeen, who taught Yusor Abu-Salha in 3rd grade. In fact, she knew all of the victims–Yusor, her husband, Deah Barakat, and her sister, Razan–since they were kid. Jabeen brought Yusor to StoryCorps last May. You’re going to hear part of that conversation, and a follow-up interview recorded just yesterday with Jabeen.
—————
Mussarut Jabeen (MJ): She was the first one to come to my mind. She was one student I would like everybody to know about.
—————
YAS: Growing up in America has been such a blessing and although in some ways I do stand out …
MJ: Yes…
YAS: Such as the hijab I wear on my head, the head covering. Um, there’s still so many ways that I feel so embedded in the fabric that is, you know, our culture. And here we’re all one.
—————
MJ: I remember Yusor as a little girl when she was in 3rd grade, she had this sense of giving that really makes her different from other children.
—————
YAS: I still remember, in 3rd grade, when we asked for something, you used to say, “Don’t put your hand like this.” You would have your hand facing downwards as if you’re taking something from someone.
MJ: Oh my god …
YAS: Yeah.
MJ: You still remember?
YAS: And then you’d flip your hand over and you’d open your hand upward as, you know, a giving gesture. You know, be giving, open, compassionate.
—————
MJ: Deah, Yusor, and Razan, these kids their face was so radiant, they would just bring light to the room. And they treat me like their mother.
—————
YAS: I see you nowadays, and you’re always asking, “How are you?” you know, “Where are you now in life?” And now I’m at NC State University.
MJ: And got married to one of my other student!
YAS: Yeah [laughs] that was, um, pretty interesting.
MJ: I was so happy, you know, when I saw you guys together. You know, that these were the two kids that we taught and you will be together for the rest of your life, inshAllah.
—————
MJ: I just remember Deah, when he was growing up, he was getting taller. And because I’m a short person, he would stand behind me and put his hand over my head. And I just told him, “Deah, you can never outgrow my heart.”
—————
YAS: Before our time is up, Sister Jabeen, I’d just like to thank you. It’s been an honor.
MJ: No, I want to thank you, Yusor. And the honor is mine. Thank you so much.
YAS: Of course.
—————
MJ: I would like people to know and remember her as a practicing Muslim, as a daughter, and above all as a good human being. You know, when we write our comments on report cards, we say “they exceeded our expectations.” She exceeded our expectations.
