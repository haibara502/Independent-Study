Joel Tucker (JT) and Gordon Blake (GB)::
JT: I was with my then partner, just got off of work. My back was to the door.  And this guy walks in with a trench coat. He bought a beer, and he sat down at a table behind us. He saw two friends of mine and one of them was Danny Overstreet. He pulled a 9mm out of his coat and just started shooting.
Danny was killed. And I reached behind my back because I felt a stinging and there was blood all over my hand.
They took me to the hospital. And I was not out at all, with anyone. The newspaper called in my room and I was so paranoid and scared that I said something that I wish I would’ve never said, and that was that I was not gay and I was straight and I was there with my girlfriend.
They put my address in the paper and I was so afraid that I would be washing my dishes, it was a wooded area out from my kitchen— I thought, 
I went back to work  with the bullet still in my back. And even at work I wasn’t out. So I really didn’t think that they would want me back, but they really helped me get through the process.
GB: So where were you when you found out about the shooting in Orlando?
JT: I caught it on the TV on the morning that it happened. And everything that happened to me completely flooded back.
My heart went out to those people so badly. When I think about all these people that are dead because of them just enjoying their life. And I think about all those people that are laying in those hospitals and suffering. You have got to be strong. Don’t let something like this ruin your life because it could’ve ruined mine.
GB: I’ve known you for a long time, Joel, and I know it’s difficult for you to share. But this was one person who hated. And I have seen hundreds of people who love. And I think Love wins.
