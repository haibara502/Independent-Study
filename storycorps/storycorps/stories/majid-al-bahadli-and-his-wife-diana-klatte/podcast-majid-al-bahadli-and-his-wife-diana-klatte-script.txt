MAB: I was working in the gas station. You came and you tried to use your debit card in the machine and the machine didn’t work. I managed to have five minutes [of] conversation with you and I gave you my phone number. And I wrote it in the slip and I said, ”I would love to get to know you better.”
DK: And I said, ”I’m not going to call you because I don’t know you.” And you said…
MA: And you took it!
DK: I did take it, but I didn’t call you.
MA: You didn’t call me. And then a month later…
DK: …I came back. And I wasn’t even sure if you’d be working. But, I went inside and there you were and you knew instantly who I was.
MA: Because I was waiting! Counting days! And nights! ”When is she going to call me, this beautiful red-head?”
DK: I was certainly intrigued. I thought about you in the intervening weeks. So, I gave you my phone number. And, I got a message like the next day or that evening saying, ”Okay I was just wondering if this was really the right phone number.” You thought that maybe I gave you a lie. (Laughs)
MA: Then we set up the first date and I waited for an hour, hour and a half.
DK: But, it was Tuesday. And of course, we had actually arranged to meet on Thursday. (Laughs)
MA: But the question is, have you fell in love with me?
DK: Well, of course I fell in love with you! But it wasn’t the first time I saw you. For me, it took getting to know you. You know, there were issues about men and women that we had to figure out. We worked through a lot. We had to have a lot of conversations.
MA: Do you have any regrets of marrying me?
DK: (Laughs) No. I wasn’t a kid, I mean, I was 30 when we met. Yeah, how about you? Can you imagine what would have happened if you hadn’t married me?
MA: I don’t know. I never thought about it. Why you want to go to the nightmare when you have a beautiful dream? Scary question.
