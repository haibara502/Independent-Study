Nick Hodges (NH) and Charlotte Wheelock (CW)
CW: I remember sleeping in the car while you were in the emergency room, the kids passed out in the back seat. We slept in the car outside. We slept in a parking garage.
NH: I felt totally guilty because I had a roof over my head, I was getting three meals a day, and I knew that you guys were out there struggling.
CW: I don’t think we talked about it at that point because…
NH: No, definitely not.
CW: …I didn’t want to burden you with it.
NH: But, when you guys would visit me in the hospital, it’s just like a sense of relief because I know that you guys are going to be safe for a few hours with me and we get to be a family.
CW: You would take over and the kids would climb up into bed with you and start watching cartoons, and I would just go in the restroom and cry.
NH: It’s a very thin line to walk when you’re trying to be normal for your kids, but, inside your head, you’re scared to death.
CW: You had gotten out of the hospital and someone had mentioned that they were opening a new apartment for families. And of the ten open apartments that they had we got one.
NH: It was just like so many doubts and worries just gone within a few seconds of hearing, “Come get your keys.” I remember moving our stuff in on the first day…
CW: And we locked the door.
NH: …and the door shut and we were able to lock it. And it was just like, these are our walls. I kicked my shoes off and sat down and I was just like — home.
CW: I mean at that point we were homeless for 14 months, and I almost forgot what it’s like to have our own place. I’m just so ready to start making plans and I’m so glad that we get to do it together.
NH: I want to thank you for being strong and working so hard for all of us, so we could be whole again.
