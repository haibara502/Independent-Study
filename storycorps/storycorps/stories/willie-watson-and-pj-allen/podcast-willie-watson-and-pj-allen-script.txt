Willie Watson (WW): We were in that hospital for three months. But I think it was about two or three weeks before you even woke up. PJ Allen (PA): I never really fully understood, like, what happened, or even what I was part of. As far as I knew I was a normal kid. WW: After all these years, 20 years, this is the first time we’ve sat down and actually talked about the bombing. I wanted to protect you, and I never wanted to relive it with you. Because, I personally hold myself responsible for you getting hurt. I was supposed to take you to the day care that day. But that morning when your mom was getting ready to go to work, she asked me, did, did I want her to take you. And I told her, I said, “Well hey, you know, I’m pretty tired. I’m going to sleep another 30 minutes or so, so go ahead and take him.” But if I would have kept you there with me, you wouldn’t have got to the federal building until the bombing would have been over. You wouldn’t have even been there. PA: I never knew that you had blamed yourself for what had happened to me that day. WW: Sometimes I’ll be sleeping, I’ll just be in a cold sweat. And I’ll wake up because of the nightmares I have. PA: I don’t want you to walk around with this burden, I want you to be alive inside. I’m never angry about my situation. I’m alright, I’m good. I like so many things about you, Dad. You’re always the coolest guy in the room. I’m like, “Alright, when I get to that age, I’m be just like him. Walk in, be the man.” WW: (laughs) PA: And, I don’t hold you responsible for that day in any way. WW: I still wrestle with it. But, you were the one that was in there. And to see you come back was a miracle, and I’m proud of you. And I love you. PA: I wouldn’t trade that for anything else in the world. I love you very much, and I’m glad that you’re my dad.
