Lloyd: Tell me about mom.
Gregory: If you were sick, stressed out about something, or whatever, I remember, many times, mom coming in, sometimes in the middle of the night. She loved waking you up in the middle of the night. Either she had a dream about you…
Lloyd: Right…
Gregory: …or was thinking about you. So you’d be sitting up at the end of your bed, and she’d put that hand on your back, take your head and bring it to her bosom, you know, rub your back counter-clockwise. And it was just like, ‘Why do my troubles seem so miniscule right now?’
Lloyd: Somehow the backrub made it like, ‘I’m okay.’ That or the fried-egg sandwich would do. You remember I went to Africa? And it was just like a thousand degrees. I was stressed out, and I just woke up one morning like, ‘I need my mama’s fried-egg sandwich. I gotta get outa here…’ I was ready to go home that day. I said, ‘I gotta get home and get an egg sandwich.’
Gregory: The egg sandwich represented home, represented comfort, and mom. Yeah. She so permeated my life, that it’s difficult for me to write a song that doesn’t have something about her in it. So, okay, I had this relationship go bad. I wrote a song, and I’m like, ‘This is the furthest thing from my mother.’ But my mother, she crept into the lyrics. (Singing)
I feel just like a kite, but one without a string. One that is floating around. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring. I wish my mama was here, a strong, a strong, steady rose. She would know what to do, what to say, how to pray to make things better. I didn’t even write these lyrics. When I went to record the song, that just came out.
