BILLY MCCUNE: Is it on?
DANNY LYON: Yeah.
MCCUNE: Allright.
LYON: 
LYON: Want to start now?
MCCUNE: Let me throw my cigarette away.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: This song was composed on the death row in 1951, by Billy McCune.

LYON: 

MCCUNE: How’s that?
LYON: Yeah that was good
MCCUNE: You don’t have no advice; you don’t have no opinion.
LYON: That was good…

LYON: 
MCCUNE: Here I am, my name is Billy McCune. My prison number is 12-20-54.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: People have often asked, ’What is a prison cell like?’ There is a door that is opened by a crank up in front. On the left or right is an iron bunk with a mattress and sheet and a pillow and against the wall is a toilet—or a commode.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: I am entirely alone and I have always been alone.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: I receive no Christmas cards from any of my relatives. No letters or nothing. No brothers no sisters no mothers no daddies. I receive no visits in the last 16 years. So you out there who are wandering along life’s road, please take my warning and try to change your way. Out there you can do many things—dance, skate, go to football games, picture shows, church, anywheres you want. You will not be thrown into a bed of rattlesnakes.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: Any man confined to a cell learns to do various things, as I have done. He has learned to read, he sings to his selfs. He tries to write a little poetry and poems. And try to rehabilitate ourself, if such a thing is possible.
LYON: 

MCCUNE: I hope this brief little story that I have told to you will give you an idea what a convict or inmate and how he lives in prison. Thank you very much.
LYON: 
MCCUNE: I’m pretty sure that I will never again go out of these prison walls alive. But I will have faith and I will have hope in the goodness and the humanism of the human race. Goodbye and may God bless you. My name is Billy McCune.

LYON: 

LYON: Well it’s good to see you—can you see me?
MCCUNE: You don’t look nothing like you did.
LYON: 

This is a book I brought. They’re pictures of artists—
This is Picasso.
MCCUNE: Picasso, yeah I heard of him. I studied some of them artists when I was locked up in isolation.
LYON: And this is Jackson Pollock.
MCCUNE: Yeah
LYON: Billy they put your picture in this book.
MCCUNE: Well which one?
LYON: I’ll show you. That’s your picture.
MCCUNE: Yeah I can see the bars and uh…
LYON: So they put you in here with all these other—
MCCUNE: I did the best I could with what I had to do with.
LYON: They say Billy McCune born 1928. And then they say that we met, 1968. Danny Lyon met Billy McCune, an inmate serving a life sentence…Lyon and McCune formed a bond that led to a unique artistic collaboration. Think that’s right?
MCCUNE: I pick up a little here and there…
LYON: 
MCCUNE: I just live live from day to day.
LYON: Billy, when we first met we made a tape recording together.
MCCUNE: Yeah. That’s how you got to me in prison and come up with ”My Last Mile”
LYON: Can you remember those lyrics?
MCCUNE: I sure do
LYON: Well why don’t we hear those?
MCCUNE: Allright, but I’m not going to try to sing: I’ve often wondered when I was a boy why I was smart and killed all of my joy…
