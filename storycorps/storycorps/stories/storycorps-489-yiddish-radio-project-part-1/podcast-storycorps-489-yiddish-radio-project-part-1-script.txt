But what a story they tell!  is a celebration of these recordings and of the forgotten geniuses and dreamers who created them.In its heyday during the 1930s, Yiddish radio flourished across America. Thirty stations in New York alone aired Jewish programming: advice shows, variety shows, man-on-the-street-interviews, news programs, music, and game shows in both Yiddish and English. The programs in this collection give us one of the most intimate snapshots of American Jewish life in the 1930s and ’40s—the collision of Yiddish and American cultures, the dawning reality of the genocide occurring across the ocean, and the day-to-day lives of immigrants struggling to make it in a new land. started when ethnomusicologist Henry Sapoznik (who is credited with sparking the Klezmer music revival in the United States) tripped over a pile of 16″ aluminum disks in a musty storage room in New York City.

The seller was thrilled.Over the years, Sapoznik has amassed the largest (and only) collection of Yiddish radio in the world—more than 500 hours of rich, wonderful, irreplaceable material from this critical and tumultuous era in American Jewish history.For the next two episodes of the StoryCorps podcast, we’ll revisit some of the public radio documentaries produced from this collection by Sapoznik, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay, and Yair Reiner as they were broadcast on NPR’s  in 2002.In Part 1, you’ll hear a brief history of Yiddish radio, memories of a show called , and one of the earliest known broadcasts of a Holocaust survivor telling his story.What?
