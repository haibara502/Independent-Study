Kaitlyn Sever (K) and Lynne Lande (L)
K: I’m Kaitlyn, I’m 10 and today’s the 10th and right now I’m being interviewed by my mom and I’m also interviewing my mom too.
L: How would you describe yourself?
K: I’d describe myself as nice, beautiful, caring, can be stubborn, huh, picky about friends.
L: What do you want to see yourself do when you’re a grown up? What do you imagine? What would make you happy?
K: I think I might want to be straight, with a nice husband and I think I would like to, uh, travel quite a bit but of course I don’t have any idea what it’s like to have kids ’cause I am a kid myself. I have a question for you.
L: Yeah.
K: How has being a parent changed you?
L: Oh my god. Being a parent has made me be much more responsible and made me really think about someone other than myself. I mean, can I tell you a little secret? I used to always worry about dying. I used to have this like huge fear of dying.
K: Brain-bug.
L: Yeah, I had this huge brain bug and um, when you came into my life, the brain bug just flew out the door.
K: Buh Bye
L: I know and I think it was really because I stopped having all of this focus on myself you know like me, me, me, suddenly there was you.
K: Do you really, truly love Anita or?
L: Very much. With all my heart.
K: And how ’bout me. Do you really, truly love me?
L: Oh my god, with like, my heart, the next door neighbor’s heart, the people around the corner’s heart, with everything I have I love you.
K: Honestly?
L: Honestly.
K: Ok. Do you wanna ask me anything else?
