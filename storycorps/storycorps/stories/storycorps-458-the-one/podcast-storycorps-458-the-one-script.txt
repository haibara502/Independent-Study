At the time, Danny was working as an OTB clerk taking bets on horse races, and his wife, Annie, was a nurse. During their conversation, they shared the story of their first date and a bold question that Danny asked Annie that evening.Over the next few years, Danny and Annie became a part of the StoryCorps family. Danny returned to the booth over and over, interviewing baseball umpires, police officers, and, of course, Annie. And when it came to talking about his wife, Danny proved to be a romantic with a gift for turning a phrase. He embodied one of the central ideas of StoryCorps—that there is poetry and beauty in the words of people you might not otherwise notice while walking down the street.In early 2006, Danny was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The disease spread quickly and he wanted to record one more conversation with Annie, but was too sick to come to the booth. So, we went to their house in Brooklyn, where Danny recorded while lying on his couch with Annie seated next to him. We broadcast that interview in February 2006. That same day, Danny died.When we posted the news online, more than a thousand letters of condolence poured in from listeners. Annie carried copies of the letters with her as she walked behind Danny’s casket at his funeral, and buried another set with him that day. Today, she reads one letter each day in place of the love letters she had received daily from Danny.Richie, who suffered from a long illness and whose stories touched so many people, died on February 10, 2016.
