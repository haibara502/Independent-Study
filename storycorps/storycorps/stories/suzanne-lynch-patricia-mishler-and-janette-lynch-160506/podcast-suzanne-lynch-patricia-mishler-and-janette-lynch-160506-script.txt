SL: So mom, how do you understand ALS? What is that illness?
PM: Well the first thing about it is it’s terminal. Most doctors will tell you three to 10 years but nobody really knows. And so, it’s a mourning process. You mourn the things you can no longer do. Mostly, I like to do things with my hands and this disease took my hands first. So something like gardening, I can’t do that anymore. And that is the most frustrating thing–you lose the ability to do the things you love best.
JL: Do you look at your life differently now than before you were diagnosed?
PM: Oh, most definitely. You see yourself decline–I can hardly feed myself–and the things you thought were so important, (laughs) not as important as you thought they were.
I mean, having you two was probably the most important thing I did in my life. I was so proud of having a child and then I was fortunate to have two. I’m glad to see the young ladies that you’ve developed into.
JL: I never knew fear because you always told me, “You want that, go do it.” There’s no way I would have accomplished a fraction of what I did in my life without you.
SL: And I don’t think I could have got through my first year of motherhood without you (laughs.) You know, I was doing it by myself so it was nice to know that I had your support.
JL: Are you afraid to die?
PM: Absolutely not. I’ll tell you what, the hardest thing is to leave you behind, but we can’t focus on that because we don’t know how long it will be–it could be a year, it could be twenty years. I’m not afraid, but I’ll be sad when the time comes. But I’ll tell you, first and foremost, the next person that tells me, “Oh, we’re all going to die of something,” I’m just going to hit. (laughs) That’s about the worst thing you can hear from anybody. (laughs)
SL: How do you want to be remembered mom?
PM: That I love my family and that I am just so proud, just so proud of that.
