Taylor Rogers (TR) and Bessie Rogers (BR)
TR: I mean it was wall to wall with people.
BR: And it was stormin’ and rainin’. He preached and he said that uh…
TR: ‘I’ve been to the mountaintop.’
BR: Oh, yeah.
MLK: Because I’ve been to the mountaintop…
TR: ‘And I’ve looked over and I’ve seen the Promised Land.’
MLK: And I’ve looked over and I’ve seen the Promised Land…
TR: ‘I might not get there with you.’
MLK: I may not get there with you…
TR: ‘But we will get there.’
MLK: But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land…
BR: And he was crying. Tears was rollin’ down his cheeks.
TR: Preachers were cryin’, people were cryin’, and everybody was cryin’ and…
BR: He really talked that night. I mean he really, really talked.
TR: You could tell by the expression on his face and the feeling and the sound of his voice that he knew something was going to happen.  He said, cause, uh, ‘I’m not fearing any man.’
MLK: I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord…
BR: Next day he was killed.
TR: You know, it’s kinda like you lost a part of your family. You just really can’t describe it. He stopped everything, put everything aside to come to Memphis to see about the people on the bottom of the ladder, the sanitation workers. After his death, we marched. You couldn’t hear a sound. You couldn’t hear nothin’ but leather against pavement. It was just some terrible days back then. But we survived and with God’s help, we came through. And it means something to know that you was a part of this.
