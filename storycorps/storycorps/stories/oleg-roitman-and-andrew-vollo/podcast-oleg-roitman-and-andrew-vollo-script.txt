Oleg Roitman (OR)
OR: My name is Oleg Roitman. My nickname is the human computer. If you tell me in Russian, Hebrew, or English any date, for example the date of your birth, in less than a second I will tell you on which day of the week you were born, Monday, Tuesday, etcetera. To prove that my answers are correct, I always carry a book with calendars from 1900 to 2020. For example, two passengers, make and female, got in my cab. They asked me to take them to Penn Station. I began to drive.
The guy, he said, ‘I was born on April 14th, 1973.’
I said, ‘Saturday.’
He said, ‘Oh, yes, yes, yes correct.’
He paid me double the meter.
I am probably the most slow driver on the road. Everybody passes me by. But very often people tell me: ’You are the best cab driver for all my life.’ And they ask me very often: ’What do you do behind the wheels with your so-smart head?’ Maybe they are right, maybe they are right.
