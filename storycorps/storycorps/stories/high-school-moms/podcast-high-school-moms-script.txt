Donofrio’s memoir was about growing up as a teen mother on welfare and putting herself through college. Savio had read it and implored Donofrio to visit the unique high school. “We got nothing but pregnant and parenting girls here,” she said. “They’re real pissers. I’ve read to them from your book. They’re going love you. You’re a success story. You got to say yes.”EPPPA was a very different school than the one Donofrio had attended. At EPPPA, a student could walk into the school pregnant, take all the academic classes required for graduation plus a coarse in parenting, have pre- and postnatal exams, deliver her baby, and return to classes two weeks later (six if she’s had a cesarean). In 1992, Donofrio visited the school and met with the students, bringing her tape recorder along.
