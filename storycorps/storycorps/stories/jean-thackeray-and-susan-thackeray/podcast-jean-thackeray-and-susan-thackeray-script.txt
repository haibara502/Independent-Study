Jean Thackeray (JT) and Susan Thackeray (ST)
JT: During the war most of the men were gone. And so there was a lot of need for people to come and thin the sugar beets and to cultivate the potatoes, so they brought the German soldiers in from Tremonton, Utah. And they had guards with them, and when they brought them in, why I had a row that my dad gave me I had to do but it was way away from the soldiers and I would weed and they would weed. And then one night when they were all through I was still out in the field and one of the soldiers was crying and I went up to the guard and I says, ”What’s wrong?”  And he says he has a little bible that he brought from Germany and he’s had it with him all his life and he’s lost it somewhere in that field, and he’s heartbroken over it. And I stayed until I found the soldiers bible in the field cause I knew which rows he was working on and I found it and when he come back the next day I gave it to him.  He was so thankful and of course he wanted to give me a hug but he couldn’t and so he asked the guard if he had a nickel and the guard gave him a nickel. And he went back and carved out of that nickel a special little necklace for me. And brought it back to me the next day. He’d left the band of the nickel all the way around but he had carved a little hole in the top and it looked like it was a half moon and then I put it on my necklace.
ST: I’ve never heard that story before.
JT: Haven’t you?  No?
ST: You’ll have to show that to me.
JT: I will.
