Debora Brakarz (DB) and Michael Wolmetz (MW)
DB: So what was the most emotionally painful thing that ever happened?
MW: Ah, thinking about it takes my breath away but my father passing away of course just over two years ago. And he was the closest person to me. It was sudden and he was supposed to pick me up from the airport in New York and I got to the airport and I called my house and my mother said, Um, you know, you’re aunt’s going to pick you up. Obviously I could detect something in her voice. There’s no way that you could hide that and I was like Tell me what it is. And my mother said, I don’t want to tell you like this. And I was like Tell me, you have to tell me, tell me. And she told me that he died in the middle of the night. (sniffling) I stood there and watched the bags go around the carousel, and I waited for my bag and I went outside and I got in my aunt’s car and, ah, I felt like no other time in my life.
(rustling)
MW: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother and we can leave it there. Um, and he saved up and he purchased this and he proposed to my mother with this and so I thought that I would give it to you so he could be with us for this also. Um, so, I’m gonna share a mic with you now Debora. Where’s the right finger? Debora, will you please marry me?
DB: Yes, of course, I love you.
(crying)
MW: So kids this is how your mother and I got married in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father’s ring. My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years used to pick people up here everyday so it seems right.
