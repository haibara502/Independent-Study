Leon: We start with no money. We had only $300 when we arrived in United States. We have no job.
Slava: No English.
Leon: no English. You understand?
Slava: I still remember how you did not sleep.
Leon: I’m start as a technician for vending machine industry. Then became engineer then became manager. I tried to do best in my job and my life.
Slava: Then you got this idea…
Leon: I was hungry and I go to available vending machine area and buy that snack. I ate the snack and still hungry. Why its not something more eat-able and more acceptable? And I decided, I have got good idea to make freshly prepared food vending machine. And my idea was to make first one as a hot dog machine. We gonna provide you by demand four different kind of hot dogs. That machine has two different compartment. One compartment keep hot dog refrigerated, another compartment keep bun in ambient temerature. And dispense one bun in warmer and deliver hot dog in hot dog cooker and cook them both then assemble them together and deliver to the customer. And people loved it.
Slava: But usually people ask me how come he’s not an American and he invent hot dog vending machine.
Leon: The hot dog, it’s a really popular product in the United States. And you don’t need to tell them what does it mean, hot dog. It’s not (?) or something.
Slava: When people ask me if I love to be here I think this is just abnormal question.
Leon: Right. We never regret we move. It’s a hard time but we know it’s a country of opportunity and I’m telling you only in America you can have idea and you can go find people who believe in your idea as well and you can go achieve something.
