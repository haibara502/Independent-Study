Clela Rorex (CR) and Sue Larson (SL)
CR: The couple came in, they asked for marriage license. And it’s the first time I met openly gay people. I said, ”I don’t know if I can do this.” And at that point I went to the district attorney and he said the Colorado marriage code did not specify that marriage had to be between a man and a woman. And therefore I did it. I honestly did not anticipate the degree of hate. It was threats–people needed to kill me for doing this, and that kind of stuff. And I had entire church congregations writing me that it would be Sodom and Gomorrah in the area. I had a small son, he was about eight, and people would call on the phone and, if he answered, they’d spiel their hatred to him.
And one day I walked into my office. I was standing and looking out my window and this horse trailer drives up and some media vans. This cowboy gets out. All of a sudden it just dawned on me, he was gonna ask for a marriage license for his horse. My deputy and I were flipping through the marriage code like crazy–you know,  So the cowboy comes in, and asked for a marriage license and I started taking information. I ask him his name and Dolly’s name—Dolly was the horse. And I said, ”And how old is Dolly?” He said, ”Eight.” And I put my pen down, calm as could be, and said, ”Well, I’m sorry, but that’s too young without parental approval.” [Laughter]
But what didn’t feel good was my actions made me kind of a laughing stock. And you know, I didn’t see through my term in office. I would not have gotten re-elected anyway.
SL: Well, there are some people out here who know what a big deal that was and what a stand you took.
CR: [Laughs] Thanks Sue, but I just was this young women in this place at this point in time. And thank goodness I made that decision, because it would be so hard for me to look myself in the mirror today, if I had not made the decision then.
