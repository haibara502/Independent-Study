Cinema Wood (CW) and Peggy Edwards (PE)
CW: World War II ended, you met Papa, my grandfather, how did you meet him?
PE: That first day I started working this man came down and I was typing and he kept looking looking at my legs and I was just a… appalled. I’d never had anybody just so blatant. We went together for 6 months and then he was going back to Chicago to finish work on his doctorate. He asked me would I marry him and I said, “Yeah”.
CW: You guys had a long strong marriage that’s for sure.
PE: Yeah. Right. We were married 52 years.
CW: What kind of advice would you have for couples like me and Drew?
PE: Be good. Be compassionate. Be kind to each other. Go slow.
CW: Go slow.
PE: Yeah. It’s not a marathon it’s a… just a stroll.
CW: That’s good advice.
PE: Yeah. Yeah.
CW: Thanks. So is there anything you’ve never told me but you want to tell me?
PE: No I tell you all the time whenever I’m talking to you. I love you oh I just love you. From the moment you were born. I looked down at you with those little shoulders and I thought, “Oh”. I was so happy.
CW: I love you too. I’m really emotional now. This was fun.
PE: I love you and I’m so happy to have been able to come.
