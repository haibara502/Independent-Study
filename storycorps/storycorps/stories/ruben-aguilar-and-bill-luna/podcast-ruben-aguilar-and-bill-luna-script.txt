Bill Luna (BL) and Ruben Aguilar (RA)
BL: So you were born in Chicago?
RA: In Chicago.
BL: Now what happened when you were deported to Mexico?
RA: Well, when I was deported what I remember is the way that the agents crashed into the house. ”Okay people. Line up against the wall.” We were put into the trucks, taken to the train station, and then shipped out. I grew up when that happened. From six years old, all of a sudden I felt like I was 15.
BL: You hadn’t been to Mexico before then?
RA: Never. I could speak fluent English, but not Spanish.
BL: Now, how did you return to the U.S.? How did you come back here?
RA: I was an American citizen. So in 1945, I was drafted into the Army. My father explained to me, he says, ”You got a little card from Chicago to join the United States Army. You’re going back to your country.” So I took the bus to the United States. It stopped in Laredo before we take off for Chicago. And I asked the bus driver, ”Where is the washroom, sir?” And he said, ”Right around the corner.” So I go around the corner and I see a big sign, No Mexicans or dogs are allowed. And I said, ”Welcome back.” You know, it’s a funny thing, because when I talk about it, you know, it looks like yesterday. Those things, you never get rid of that.
BL: How do you want to be remembered, Ruben?
RA: I want to be remembered as somebody got hurt by his country, came back to this country, and is going to die in his country.
