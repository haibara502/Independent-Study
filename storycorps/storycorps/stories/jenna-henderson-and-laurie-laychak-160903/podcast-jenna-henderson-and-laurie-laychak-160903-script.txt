Jenna Henderson (JH) and Laurie Laychak (LL):
JH: He had eyes the color of a swimming pool. They were the lightest blue, and they sparkled. I mean, it wasn’t just the color. And he always made sure that I felt loved.
I can remember the times that he took me for motorcycle rides. And it’d be winter almost in Washington. And we’d be freezing, yet we’d be riding up in the mountains. And I can remember looking through the tall trees out at the sound, feeling the cold on my face and having my arms wrapped around him, thinking there’s no place I’d rather be.
When Kayley was 18 months old, I remember it was storming. And he put on her bathing suit and his bathing suit and they were out playing in mud puddles … in the pouring rain. He was such a goofball.
And there was a lake right down from the house, and I can remember many times seeing the two of them with feet in the water just fishing and talking.
There are things that come out in her that I see of him … like when she’s upset, her little eyebrow twitches … and when she smiles, she’s kind of got that little crooked smile he had … and when she laughs, you can see the light in her. And next year when she starts high school, one of her courses is JROTC. So I mean, she’s trying to follow in his footsteps.
But I mean … I miss him horribly. It hurts … Cause I mean when it comes down to it, somebody took his life, so I’ll never be at peace with that fact. But I don’t think I could have married a better man. Matter of fact, one of the last letters I got was an apology for something that had happened a year or two before. In it, he said how much he loved me and how he was glad that he had married me, and that he wouldn’t have changed that for the world. And that would be the one thing that I would want to tell his grandchildren or his great grandchildren or his great great grandchildren that he was a man that they could be very proud of.
