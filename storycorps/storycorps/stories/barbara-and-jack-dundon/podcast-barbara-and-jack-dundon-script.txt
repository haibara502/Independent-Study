Barbara Dundon (BD): She met Robert when she was 90 and he was 17 years her junior. He was a hot number there for all the women and he was hot for mom. He brought her flowers, cards, and she flourished under this love and attention.
Jack Dundon (JD): Tell us about Christmas.
BD: Christmas with Robert.(laughs)
We came over Christmas Eve as we always did and I said as we were leaving, ‘We’ll see you tomorrow, Mom. How about ten o’clock? Is that a good time?’
Cause we were coming back with the presents. And then the next morning we arrived, started to open the door and it was locked. I said, ‘Mom, we’re here! ‘ Nothing happened and we heard voices in the room and shuffle, shuffle, I hear mom’s little walker coming toward the door, “Oh honey, I’ll be right there.”
And we walk in and there’s Robert, and he was putting his shoes back on! (laughs)
Everybody was kind of embarrassed but that was a great time. And you and I would have movie night with her every Saturday night. We’d have wine, greasy pizza, and we’d bring her to her little sitting room.
JD: What I remember about her is her love for sex and violence in the movies. (laughs)
BD: (laughs) You’re right. (laughter)
And being there where she made her little home for five years, I felt like the three of us were a little team. I loved that you were so close with her.
JD: In a way she had become my mother. How we knew each other, how we had cared for her, um, she had really kind of moved in there and I realized after she died how much I missed having a mother. (chuckles)
And I’ll never have a mother like that again.
