Chloe Smith (CS) and Willie Jefferson (WJ)
CS: What were your first days like at OLA?
WJ: Oh my first day at OLA, it was kind of scary, just like a new student. Being a Catholic school, my first boss, she was a nun. I never had met a nun before. She was a nice lady though.
CS: You are married though, correct?
WJ: Yes I am, twenty-four years. Unfortunately, we don’t have kids, but God made up for it. I got all of you guys.
CS: Cuz you feel like parents to all of us students and so you’re like family. You are!
WJ: That’s nice. I feel the same way. It’s like the whole school, all the kids are my family. And I’m going to watch out for you just like I would watch out for them.
CS: What would be your favorite time of day?
WJ: It’s lunch time. I see you at your desks at lunch, and you’re free and expressing yourselves, and I also pray with the kids. ’Father, we give you thanks for these and all your gifts which we have received through Christ our Lord. Amen.
CS: Every day you say that, and I love it. What were your first impressions of me?
WJ: Chloe, well you know you always have been a standing out person with me. Diplomatic little lady. You’re always solving problems. You got a lot of people that follow you. You’re a little leader. Yeah, you’re a good kid.
CS: Thank you.
WJ: Yeah, you’re on the right track, Chloe. Just stay focused sweetheart and all of the good things will come to you.
