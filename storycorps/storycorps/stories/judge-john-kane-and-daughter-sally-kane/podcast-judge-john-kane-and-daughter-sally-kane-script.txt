JK: When I was a little kid I went to a Catholic church and the parish pastor was an absolute tyrant. He would name people from the pulpit, as to they’d done something he didn’t like. There was one guy in that whole church that he never ever did anything except nod his head in respect, and that guy had a black suit and his name was Walsh. And I asked my mother, I said, ”Why does everybody treat Mr. Walsh that way?” She says, ”It’s not mister, it’s judge.”
SK: And you thought …
JK: I thought …
SK: Looks good to me.
JK: That’s what I want to be. That’s what I want to be. When I was appointed to the bench, almost thirty-two years ago, my friends would say, ”Well, what’s the difference? Being a trial lawyer and now you’re a judge.” And I said, ”Well for the first time in my life I’m actually listening rather than waiting for someone to be quiet so I can come back with a quick repartee.”
SK: What do you think it does for the person who’s being listened to by you?
JK: Well I think they are appreciative. Especially in a court where they’ve waited so long for somebody to listen. One of my pet peeves is when a judge isn’t paying attention. And a court is a sort of secular temple, where people come and they expect to be heard. And they should be.
