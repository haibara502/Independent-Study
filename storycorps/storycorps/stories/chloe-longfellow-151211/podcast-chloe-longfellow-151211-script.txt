In order to support her family, Chloe’s mother, Dorsey Romano, was forced to take on a variety of jobs, some of which required her to work the night shift.With her mother away, Chloe spent a great deal of time at her grandparents’ home becoming especially close with her grandmother, Doris Louise Rolison.Despite living in the Arizona desert, Doris, who died in May 1988 at the age of 67, maintained a lush garden of herbs and vegetables. Chloe would help harvest the food to make dishes from recipes found in one of her grandmother’s treasured cookbooks (see below).At StoryCorps, Chloe remembers the happy memories and life lessons taught to her by her grandmother, many of which took place while cooking in Doris’ kitchen.
