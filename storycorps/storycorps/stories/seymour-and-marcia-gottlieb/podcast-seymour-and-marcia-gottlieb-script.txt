Seymour Gottlieb (SG) and Marcia Gottlieb (MG)
MG: Our journey started a long, long time ago.
SG: Must I tell everybody you worked for me?
MG: It’s the truth.
SG: Well, she worked for me.
MG: I was the cashier. SG: I had a surplus store. I knew her friend Helen and I told Helen one day, You know, I need a cashier, do you know anybody? And here came old Marsha. I looked her over and said to myself, Gee, whiz, what a funny looking broad. But she has good credentials–
MG: She can count
SG: She can count. I said, all right, I’ll give her a chance.
MG: Do you have any questions for me kid?
SG: I have nothing to ask you, everything about you I THINK I know. Your brassiere size, your dress size, the true color of your hair. That’s a lot of baloney that blonde hair for crying out loud. I’m very lucky to have my mate this long. Look at that beautiful face. When we first met she didn’t have–you see the wrinkles in her face? She didn’t have any wrinkles. Now she’s a good looking old lady. You know, the older you get, there are different needs you have from your mate and she has met all of them.
MG: The other day he asked me about one of the grandchildren, who’s kid is this one and I told him, I was so amazed because usually he’s right there with the grandchildren, he knows who their parents are and stuff.
SG: Well, I can’t be perfect all the time. Most of the time yes but all the time no.
MG: It’s true., Seymour. Seymour, as old as you are–
SG: 87–
MG: –as big a fart as you are,
SG: –I am that
MG: –I do love you.
SG: You do? Well, I can’t help it. I don’t know if medication will also help you. The longer I know her, the more I appreciate her. Cause she’s my pal, she’s my best friend. Not the best cook in the world but she makes reservations very well.
