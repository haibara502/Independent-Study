Louise Caplan (LC) and Harriet Caplan (HC)
LC: A group of us met after work on Wednesday evenings, and it was an eclectic mixture of people.
HC: We went to football games and concerts, and I still don’t quite know how it happened. But instead of going in two separate cars, you and I would start going in the same car. I don’t think we ever had a date.
LC: That is true.
HC: How did you decide you were wanting to love me?
LC: That is not something that is decided—it’s something that happens. I had been unmarried all my life.
HC: Why didn’t you ever marry?
LC: Never found you.
HC: [Laughs] I had never married either, and neither of us were exactly children. But suddenly it was like it seemed right.
LC: And I asked her to marry and…
HC: I said yes.
LC: She said yes.
HC: We’re confronting now some issues in our lives that are gonna make the next two years different for us. I found out I had colon cancer. And in all likelihood, I have a life expectancy of about two years now. But I want to tell you in this period that of anything that I have been blessed with, you are the biggest blessing of my life. And that I intend to spend this period of time—as long as I can—living.
LC: Well you hold the same position in my life, and I expect to live it with you and help you live it.
HC: Thank you. You know how much I love you.
LC: And you know how much I love you.
