Talana Banks (TB): My name is Talana Banks. I am 9 years old.
Willie Banks (WB): My name is Willie. I’m 12.
Felicia Banks (FB): My name is Felicia Banks, and I am here with my son, Willie, and my daughter, Talana.
TB: So how did it make you feel to leave us for your deployment?
FB: Well, I remember that morning when I left, it was uh, probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. And I just prayed that we be together again.
WB: At first, I thought you were just going to the store or something, but then I noticed you weren’t coming back.
FB: I probably did a poor job of explaining to you where I was going and what I was up against. But at your age, you shouldn’t have to worry about me. I’m the one that’s supposed to worry about you.
TB: Why did you decide not to come back for a whole year?
FB: Are you mad that I didn’t come back for a whole year?
TB: Yes.
FB: All right. They give you two weeks of what they call ‘Rest and Relaxation.’ So for me to come back for two weeks and then leave again, I thought it would just disrupt your lives. So, I just decided to stay the whole year and come back at the end. So when I came back, how did you feel?
WB: I got really excited when I saw you coming towards us. I got the biggest hug in the world. And I didn’t know if you were going to leave again or not. I was just happy to see you.
FB: You’d gotten so big, so I hugged you–I kissed your face. Yeah. And then, Talana, I saw you.
TB: I was confused. I didn’t know who you were. And then I’m like, ”Oooooh…”
FB: I remember the look on your face when you realized who I was. Your eyes got really big, you just started hugging…hugging me, I think you were choking my neck.
TB: Well, I’m proud of you because you’re serving our country. But I like when you’re home.
FB: I like being home. I love you guys.
WB: Love you too.
TB: You’re awesome.
