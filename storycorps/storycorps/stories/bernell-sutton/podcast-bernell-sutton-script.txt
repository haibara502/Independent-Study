BS: Claudia to me was very beautiful. Round features, hair was about shoulder-length and very fun to be around. She would just come up behind me and tickle me. I can remember waking up that morning–I was running late. Claudia herself was running late, she’s a fanatic, she has to be at work on time. But I can remember, she said, ”Where do you think you’re going? You know you don’t leave without kissing me.” She says to me, ”This afternoon, I will pick up the children. We’ll just walk home if it’s nice enough.” It was a very, very nice day that morning.
Looking back, it just never happened. My sister, she called me and she told me she was going to send her godmother to pick up my little girl, Kadisha. Kyle got picked up by his grandmother. I stayed at home. Waiting. For a call. For the doorbell. Anything. There was never anything found of my wife.
My children asked me, so I told them that God rescued mommy from the building and took her home. I often remember just before September 11, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, we always have a BBQ at my mothers. Claudia was having fun–you could see her distinct laughter that she has, that person that’s full of life. You know, she had a serious side when it comes to work but at home or with her friends, she was always that vibrant and happy person. I think she wanted to be remembered that way. Being a very loving, understanding, caring person.
