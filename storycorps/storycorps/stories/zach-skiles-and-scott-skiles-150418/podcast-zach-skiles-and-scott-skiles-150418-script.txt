Scott Skiles (SS) and Zach Skiles (ZS)
SS: I remember saying to you, ”every gift that I’ve been given, I don’t have a better one than to get to be your dad.” And I remember you smiling and saying, ‘I love you too dad’. And then you got out of the car and went to war. So what was life like after you came home?
ZS: I was pretty sure someone was going to kick down my door, and I was scared to go to sleep. I couldn’t sustain employment. I couldn’t pay rent and pay for groceries. It all just kind of fell apart, and then I was homeless. The crazy thing was that I didn’t think there was anything super-wrong. You know, the nighttime I stayed on coastal trails and hiking trails, and in the day time I could just pass out at a park.
SS: There was a time period where I didn’t know where you were. And it is difficult to watch anyone let go of hope, but when it’s your son, it’s excruciating. I remember great relief that you decided to go into inpatient treatment. And I remember one night you getting out of the car to walk back into the treatment building. It was dark and your head was kind of down, and for a moment I could feel the weight you were carrying. As I watched you walk into that building I uttered these two words –I don’t know if they were some kind of prayer or not, but they just came out— ‘my son’. And I was absolutely overcome with grief, and love, and the beginning of hope. What is life like for you now?
ZS: It’s pretty cool.
SS: You graduated undergrad.
ZS: Yes.
SS: I heard Summa Cum Laude.
ZS: (Laughs)
SS: I’m just asking. That’s what I heard.
ZS: Yeah.
SS: I remember my dad saying this to me and I feel it is so true between you and I: it is your life, so you have the last word. But then as your dad that gives me the second to the last word. And the second to the last word is I believe in you, and I’m on your side.
