AL: We need to identify the insect. That’s the first thing you have to do. You have to identify the pest. Believe it or not this is very scientific type of work. One of the big issues of the day is bedbugs. I had a gentleman came in yesterday, thought he had bedbugs. He shows me the sample, I look at it and it’s a ladybug. Just an Asian beetle. Big deal. And the guy almost cried. He said, “Oh thank god I thought I had bedbugs”. I do this every day. I don’t respect an insect but if you look deep enough there’s always something fascinating about even the most unpleasant creatures. I mean roaches. Let’s face it. Roaches are spectacular. They’ve been around for billions of years. There’s something to be said about an insect like that. In this field you don’t expect a person with an advanced degree, who speaks 3 languages, who is a classically trained musician because it doesn’t make sense. What the hell are you doing killing bugs? That’s the question. How’d you get involved in this? My uncle had a pest control company. When I’d hit the brick wall and couldn’t find employment my uncle just happened to be ready to retire. Because it wasn’t what I had trained for, it wasn’t what I expected, I went in with a great deal of resentment. And for a time I was turning off customers cuz I would answer the phone that way you know just “bug off!” so I had to follow that up “Bug Off, pest control center. Can I help you?” you know. So I wouldn’t loose that much clientele. Then I changed the mindset and I said wait if I make somebody feel better and he’s more at ease that’s, that’s golden.
