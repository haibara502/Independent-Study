Ky-Antre Compton (KC) and Stuart Chittenden (SC)
SC: So how long have we known each other now?
KC: Probably a year.
SC: Does it feel that long?
KC: Yes, more like nineteen years. When I first met you, I thought this is going to be so boring. This is going to ruin my whole summer, my whole life. But then, you taught me respect. You taught me how to be mature. You taught me how to be a young man. You know how I ask you all time, ’Why are you so polite, why are you so respectful?’
SC: Uh – huh
KC: I understand that you are trying to just be a good mentor to me, and I love that. And there’s times when you messed up. You told me it’s okay to make mistakes, it’s okay to get mad but it’s just not okay to get out of control. So Stuart what are the things you believe in? Like if you believe in God, are you scared that he won’t pick you to go to heaven or something?
SC: Well I don’t believe in God, so I don’t have a faith, like you have a faith. But I do worry about living my life now, to be the best that I can be. Does it bother you that I don’t have a faith in God?
KC: Sometimes it makes me shocked but no, that’s your belief. I can tell you one thing, you are the best role model I’ve ever had.
SC: I think we’re teaching each other stuff.
KC: Which makes us more closer.
SC: I want you to know that this isn’t a one-way relationship. I’m learning how to be fun and engaging and open, so I want to thank you for that Ky-Antre.
KC: You welcome.
SC: You think we’re going to be friends for a long time?
KC: You really want to know what I think?
SC: I do.
KC: I think we’re going to be big brothers for a long time.
