Rita Fischer (RF) and Jay Fischer (JF)
RF: When you called and came out it was quite a shock. I had no inkling–none whatsoever. You tell me you’re gay, and I said, ”Listen. Give me a half hour to come to myself, and I’ll call you back.” And so I did call back and I said, ”This is not telephone discussion. I think you best come speak with dad and I. But don’t worry we’re going to love you the same way.”
JF: When you talked about not knowing about me being gay, I mean, I consider you a lot of things but dumb isn’t one of them, and I had left so many clues.
RF: I don’t know what clues you’re talking about.
JF: I had somebody over for three times a week for five years.
RF: In my house?
JF: In your house. I had a fuck buddy.
RF: That’s what you call them? Fuck buddies?
JF: (Laughs) Well I can call them a lot of things. But…
RF: [Laughs] I don’t know what you call them, but I didn’t know, and that’s all. I would not be so dumb now. I have what they call gaydar.
JF: God bless.
RF: I can pick them up in a minute.
RF: And the very high point for me was when you, Jay, and Michael had your commitment ceremony.
JF: Yes.
RF: Dad I and were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary. And you suggested that we make it a joint celebration. And when dad and I walked you down that aisle. I was so overwhelmed that I thought I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. It was one of my bursting moments of pride.
JF: I consider you a blessing to both me and Michael. And that’s as best as I can put it.
RF: I think straight parents should be involved with their gay children. I told everybody and anybody who would listen to me, that I had a gay son and that I was very proud of my gay son.
