Kara Masteller (KM) and James Kennicott (JK)

How did you know that grandma was the one?
JK: Well she was a good looker. (Laughs) We fit together. We were a good pair.

KM: Were you nervous to propose to her?
JK: No. We had something to say we said it. Like you. (Laughs)
KM: What are the keys to a happy marriage?
JK: Well if something happens just say, ‘I’m sorry’ and get it over with. There’s no reason to carry on. I just say ‘I’m sorry. I love ya,’ and that was the whole story.
KM: (Laughs)

How would you like to be remembered?
JK: Remem—? Ha. (laughs)
KM: Do you want to be remembered as like a real tough guy? Or…
JK: I was a pretty soft guy.
KM: You intimidated me when I was little.
JK: I did? (Laughs)
KM: Yeah. You did.
KM: Are you happy about the life you’ve lived?
JK: Oh yeah. It wasn’t the easiest life back in them days. Mother died when I was four. And it was a tough life.
KM: He tells one story about how I think he was eight or nine and he was ice skating on the river and he fell through and he didn’t have hot water wherever he was living with his dad. So he broke into the school and just took a hot shower in the school. I think that says a lot about his childhood that there was really no one there to help him get out of the water or keep him warm.

What do you think about Alzheimer’s?
JK: Not much you can do. I even can’t remember some names now myself. (Laughs) So maybe I have got it. I don’t know.

As people age, do you have any advice for them as they get older?
JK: It’s coming.
KM: (Laughs)
JK: Don’t fight it. Just roll with. I mean real life. Live it. It’s wonderful.
KM: (Laughs) Thank you grandpa.
