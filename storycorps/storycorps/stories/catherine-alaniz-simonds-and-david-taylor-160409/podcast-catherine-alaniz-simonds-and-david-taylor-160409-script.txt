Catherine Alaniz-Simonds (CAS) and David Taylor (DT)
DT: Most of us, in our unit, had been fighting for over three and a half days with no sleep and some pretty horrible weather conditions. And I remember the brigade commander said “I need to know if anybody has any concerns.” I saw there’s potential that there would be friendly fire. And I could have said something and I didn’t.
CAS: You know, mistakes were made, things happen, but I’ve never blamed you. 
DT: For the last 25 years, every day I thought about it.  I feel that this whole thing could have been prevented. 
CAS: I don’t think it’s your place to carry that burden any longer. Andy would not want that, that’s not how he was.  
DT: The fact that you say that makes it easier for me to accept. Yesterday we actually met for the first time and of course I was a little scared. I did not want to come here. But I told myself I would make it right. Sorry it took 25 years to do it.
CAS: Well I’m glad I convinced you to come to this.
DT: I can’t say no to you on basic requests like that.
CAS: ‘Cause I’m stubborn.
DT: ‘Cause you’re stubborn. Now that I met you, I feel whole. I can live my life now. And without doing this there would still be an emptiness in me.
CAS: And I’m just grateful that you finally reached out. Because I thought I was the only one that remembered him. That’s my biggest fear, is that as time goes on people will forget.
DT: I’ll never let that happen. That event changed my life. And so there’s two of us, we’ll make sure he’s not forgotten.
