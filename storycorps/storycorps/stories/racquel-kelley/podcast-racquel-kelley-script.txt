RK: One thing that I do remember, very vividly and clearly, is the impact. I can like relive that like it just happened. Everything was on fire and I climbed under my desk and I remember saying a prayer: Lord, look. I just had this baby, now I need to go to proms, marriages, and all of that. I can’t die. So we gotta work something out.
I grabbed my purse and my other bag–they laughed at me at the hospital cause they said I had my bags with me–and I looked for my cell phone but I couldn’t feel it cause my hand was on fire and I was still trying to figure out what is going on around here.
So, they flew me to Washington Hospital’s burn unit…that’s when I started to get the full gist of what was happening. In some form or fashion, every day I think about 9/11. You know, I’m going into my building in Crystal City I’m sitting there going, What if a plane crashed, where am I gonna go? And, when I’m coming across 14th Street Bridge, do I speed up or slow down and let that plane go?
So I’m always constantly thinking, What am I going to do, What if. I think I’ll be like that for the rest of my life.
