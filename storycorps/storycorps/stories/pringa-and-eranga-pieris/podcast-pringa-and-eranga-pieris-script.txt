Prianga Pieris (PP) and Eranga Pieris (EP)
PP: My name is Prianga Pieris.
EP: My name is Eranga. Prianga is my husband and we’re from the beautiful island of Sri Lanka
PP: And we are… we sing for a living.
EP: I composed a song. It’s a song about the sea and since we are from an island, you know, the ocean plays a very important part in our lives. And it’s called Ralabindu (sp?). It’s a Sri Lankan fisherman’s love song and a lot of Sri Lankans feel very homesick when it’s played.
PP: Can you get the key?
They sing the song.
PP: This song talks about a fisherman and how his lover is waiting for him on the shore and she’s trying to make a garland of flowers out of the waves and
EP: …welcome him home…
PP: …and welcome him home…
EP: …and most of them didn’t come back…
PP: …because of what happened last year on this 26th of December this tsunami which hit our island. So it’s… so we, you know what I mean, when we sing it now it has kind of a added significance and a different dimension.
