NATHAN SMITH:: 
SMITH:: You checking out?
TENANT:: Yeah, I didn’t like the fleas in the bed.
SMITH:: Fleas?
SMITH:: Yeah, I had fleas. I scratched all night, the whole time I was here. Yeah, roaches all over the wall.
SMITH:: 
TENANT:: You want to see ID of any kind?
SMITH:: No, I believe you. This is the kind of hotel where everybody gives an AKA anyway.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Okay, here you are my friend, you’re all set.
HENRY FOGELMAN:: Thanks a lot buddy.
SMITH:: Okay, you can square yourself away, this that and the other
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Welcome to the Sunshine Hotel.
SMITH:: 
FOGELMAN:: Thanks a lot. I’m Henry by the way.
SMITH:: Henry, I’m Nathan. Okay my friend, okay.
HENRY:: Pleased to meet you.

SMITH:: What’s up garden, what’s happening?
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Yeah, what can I do for you?
TENANT:: I’d like to pay my rent.
SMITH:: Good. You made the landlord a happy man.
SMITH:: 

SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Sunshine give me a ten-four.  Hey Eddie, Eddie do me a favor! See if you can get Earl Simpson. Tell Earl it’s his mother. Earl! Earl! Wake him up and throw him out his bed. Tell him it’s his mother.
SMITH:: 
TENANT:: Can I have some toilet tissue?
SMITH:: 35 cents a slice, I’ll put it on your tab. You want paper too? Okay.
SMITH:: 
FOGELMAN:: My name’s Henry Fogelman and I live in room 36-A. Basically it’s the size of a jail prison cell. It’s got a light and bed, mattress and blanket, with screen wire on the top. And basically, that’s about it.
DANNY:: It’s very tiny. It’s so small you have trouble making the bed.
CHARLIE:: I’ve been in prisons, jails, I been upstate, down-state. My cells were five times bigger than my room.
SMITH:: 

SMITH:: This is Eddie.
SMITH:: 
EDDIE BARRETT:: Hello
SMITH:: Eddie’s been with us about 100 years..
BARRETT:: It’s a new day Sunshine and the world is still here, we’re still here. So that’s good . . . hey . . .
SMITH:: 
BARRETT:: I’m gonna play you Johnny Cash . . . Johnny Cash. That’s my inspiration, Johnny Cash.
SMITH:: 
BARRETT:: Maybe I might sit down and come up with a new tune in my mind, but by the time I pick up the guitar, I done forgot the tune I had in my mind, see?
SMITH:: Eddie used to work as a band boy for Tito Puente, but he had mental breakdown and ended up at this flop.
BARRETT:: I met a nice guy on the street, and he knew the Bowery and he told me ”You looking for a hotel? Come on with me, I’ll show you a hotel. This place called Sunshine. It ain’t bad.” So we went together. That’s how it started.
SMITH:: 

COOKIE::  Somewhere Over The Bowery . . .
HOLLIS:: Hey Nate, let me lean on you for another smoke. Yeah, light it up for me Nate, my hands are cold. I ain’t got no feeling in them.
SMITH:: 
PAUL DONOGHUE:: 
SMITH:: This is Donoghue Bowery. He loves this place
DONOGHUE:: 
SMITH:: This gentleman here, this is our sue maven.
BOB RUSSIN:: Yeah, I’m Bob Russin.
SMITH:: He sues everybody in town. I think he’s suing the Pope now for malfeasance. Or Father O’Connor . . .
SMITH:: What happened? This is Vinnie here . . . this Vinnie. . . what happened?
VINNIE GIGANTE:: 
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Yeah . . . yeah . . . yeah . . . yeah, that’s Vinnie.
GIGANTE:: This is the manager. He’s the best guy here. I’ve been here seven years. This man is like my adopted father. And he’ll tell you.
SMITH:: 
GIGANTE:: I came here because I was addicted to heroin. I didn’t want to bother my family any more, so I’ve been here since then. And I will be here until I die probably.

SMITH:: 
GIGANTE:: This is Pretty Boy — he’s ten years old. This is Little Bit — he’s five. He’s a devil — yes you are.

GIGANTE:: They take good care of each other. If it wasn’t for these birds, I don’t think I’d have made it in this place. These birds have been my life. So many people don’t realize you need something, you know, to help you through everything. Or you’re not going to make it.

ANTHONY COPPOLLA:: Hey Pop!
SMITH:: Tell me something, slick Anthony. Tell me what’s going on.
SMITH:: 
COPPOLLA:: Sometimes I knock off a 26-ounce can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli. That is for five people in the family. And I be eating it cold right out of the can. That is a load of eats! That’s a lot of grub there!
SMITH:: 
COPPOLLA:: Why should I go anywhere? If I want air, I just open up the window. Turn on my fan a little higher, and I got air. 
SMITH:: 
COPPOLLA:: I don’t want to leave, not yet. Too much like home . . . too much like home. You been in a place such a long time people get to be like family, you don’t want to leave.
COPPOLLA:: Let this young fellow in. This is my lunch.
BRUCE DAVIS:: A little light snack. 
SMITH:: 
COPPOLLA:: Alright. Thank you.
BRUCE:: Yeah, that’s my dinner.
SMITH:: 
VOICE:: Bruce!
SMITH:: 
VIC K.:: Okay. Tea two sugars, one Rolaid, two packs of Monarch non filter, large bacitracin, one pack ginseng, two packs Anacin. There you go.
BRUCE:: Tea two sugars, Rolaids . . .
SMITH:: 
BRUCE:: 
VIC:: 11 should cover it. Okay.
BRUCE:: 

BRUCE:: Tea two sugars, one Rolaid, two packs of monarchs, large Bacitracin.
BRUCE:: 
BRUCE::  All I need is a tea with two sugars.
BRUCE:: 
BRUCE:: Yeah, tea with two sugars.
BRUCE:: 
BRUCE:: How much are the Rolaids?
CLERK:: 75
BRUCE:: OK, I gave you a dollar.
CLERK:: I gave you 50 cent back.
BRUCE:: 
BRUCE:: Check and make everything’s all right.
BRUCE:: 
BRUCE:: $1.37 your change.

SMITH:: Showtime. Showtime at the Apollo.

SMITH:: Why, here’s the phone. Business!  Sunshine, give me a ten-four. No, he’s not here. Didn’t come in yet. But if he comes in I’ll tell him. Alright.Cookie wants 20 dollars. So when the loan shark comes in I’ll tell him. Leave $20 for Cookie.
FATS:: Cookie with no teeth? Right, I know Cookie.
SMITH:: Yeah, everybody’s no teeth around here. In fact my greatest wish will be when I can have myself a set of choppers. You know what I mean?

ARTHUR MORRISON:: My name is Arthur Morrison. I’m 63 now. I came to the Sunshine Hotel in 1960. At that time it was bars all over the Bowery, two or three bars on every block. And it was like Broadway, it never closed. And the whole Bowery was filled with nothing but alcoholics then. Most of the people that I knew that was on the Bowery is dead now, because of alcohol. And, so I’m lucky to be alive. I know that. Survive those years on the Bowery, you know. It’s rough living. Really rough living.

SMITH:: 
BUCKALOO:: They should make this building landmark status.
SMITH:: Yeah, that’s an idea.
MASSA:: Yeah, sure is. If we didn’t have this place, we’d be in the streets, a lot of guys here. This is the only thing we can afford.
LA NELSON:: This is a place where wise men do not dwell.. This place is the Last of the Mohicans.
SMITH:: 
KERRY:: 
SMITH:: Hey! Take Kerry in the back! Yeah, tie him up and take him in the back.
SMITH:: 
HOLLIS:: I’m gonna build me a summer resort.
SMITH:: Yeah, right.
HOLLIS:: I’m gonna have an artificial football field, I’m gonna have four basketball courts, I’m gonna have a round oval 440 track. Track, Nate, track! Then I’m going to have . . .
SMITH:: Hollis, don’t you think that’s a little over-ambitious? Why don’t you just do one thing?
HOLLIS:: You got to have direction, Nate. I’m having a summer resort and this is what it’s going to be composed of.
SMITH:: 
LAWRENCE:: Emotionally distraught people find a home in the Sunshine Hotel. And I found home inside me. White is girl color, black is boy color, blue is emotion . . .
JEFFREY MANGONES:: My name is Jeffrey Mangones. I live in the Sunshine Hotel. I’m from a family of multi billionaires. My mother’s a multibillionaire. So’s my sister . . .
SMITH:: 
VIC:: In my case, I started off like probably so many people, maybe everyone for all I know. With sweet dreams you know.
SMITH:: 
VIC:: I had some crazy, soaring ambitions of figuring out everything . . . figuring out everything. I was on the old impossible quest for ”truth.” You know? Ahh . . . it’s like singing from that song ”What’s it all about, Alfie?” Who hasn’t wondered what it’s all about. Some fierce ambitions along those lines. I don’t know. Seemed like I was making some progress. It was intoxicating. And after a while, it seemed like some crazy pipe dream, as they say. You know, figure there’ve been a lot more substantial heavyweights than me, by far, through history, and they didn’t seem to come up with the answers. The big answers. So where do I get off thinking I had a chance for that. Seems like one of those stories better left untold. To me it seems that way.
SMITH:: Could I get an ambulance here to the Sunshine Hotel, 241 Bowery? One of my tenants is very ill
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Here they are now.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Yeah, look at him, he’s starving to death.
AMBULANCE MAN:: Why don’t you come on outside?
SMITH:: Hasn’t had any food, the whole nine yards.
SMITH:: 
AMBULANCE MAN:: Keep your hands on your lap. Don’t reach out to grab anything. Just lean back and relax.
SMITH:: 
EDWIN:: You say you’re going to throw everything away?
SMITH:: Put it in a bag. Put in a bag, yeah.
SMITH:: 
EDWIN:: You see a lot of urine all over the floor. A lot of those milk cartons full of urine. It’s the worst part, cleaning up rooms like this. Ahh . . .

SMITH:: Watford’s gone, Robinson’s gone, Dave Rodriguez is gone.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Calvin is gone, Ray is gone. Rodney — he’s deceased. This is the guy that got shot by the maintenance man here in the lobby over five bucks. Marcus is gone, Ozario’s gone.
DONALD:: It’s like a death house. Okay, the seven months I’ve been here, five guys have died. Okay? And these guys will never leave the building. I mean months and months at a time. One guy I knew didn’t leave this building for one year. He says ”Donald.” He says ”I’m gonna die in this place.” So it scares me. It scare me.
CHARLIE:: I can’t go no lower than this. I can’t. The only thing I can do now is start, like a little chicken, start crawling out of the egg.
DONALD:: I wake up in the morning and sit in the bed, smoke a cigarette and say to myself ”Donald, what the hell are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here?”
MAX R.:: Most of the people just lay on their bed all day in their cubicle, watching TV or listening to the radio or staring into space or sleeping, and just keep vegetating in these little cells. With fluorescent light overhead coming through chicken-wire. And that’s their life.
SMITH:: 
MAX:: This is my chance to get away, where I don’t have to do anything for anyone, and just indulge to the maximum without being worried about what anyone’s going to say, or how I’m going to affect others. No one knows that I’m here. It’s just a complete getaway.
SMITH:: 
MAX:: There’s a painting of Durer’s Saint Jerome, who was a hermit. He went to the desert and lived by himself for a very long time to try to seek knowledge. And achieve illumination. In a sense that’s what I’m doing too, I guess. It’s um, grotesque, and I enjoy it. It’s like that movie . The experience is so disgusting, so grotesque, so gross, but they make an art out of it. I’m kind of making an art out of experiencing this.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Max, they crashed him up against the wall several times, handcuffed and took him out of here. And that means his room is available for anybody that wants to rent. He’s just a clean-out now. Nothing personal. He’s a clean-out, and I’m gonna clean him out and sell his room. Maybe tomorrow. I’ll probably sell it tomorrow, more than likely.
SMITH:: Sign here, my friend. Sign and print.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Wolford, I hope you enjoyed your stay here.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: You’re welcome to come back anytime, buddy.
WOLFORD:: Very good.
SMITH:: And good luck, buddy.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Okay, Wolford. Tony, you gonna help him?
TONY:: Yeah.
SMITH:: Good, good.
SMITH:: 
SMITH:: Take care my friend. Be careful. God bless buddy.
