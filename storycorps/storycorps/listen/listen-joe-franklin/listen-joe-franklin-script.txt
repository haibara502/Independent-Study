 Hello?
 
 Richard, I want to tell you something. I got so many surprises for you. Let’s talk tonight at 7: 00. Promise? It’s critical!

 Dan I need you maniacally, pathologically!

 Tell him that things are concretizing. Things are coming together. They’re coagulating!
(Slam)
 Very important, Rosalyn!

 Put it on the critical list, critical!

 Give me a hint! Give me a clue!

 Tell him give me one more day to think!

 Call back in a half hour!

 Once or twice a year the phone actually explodes, like an artery, like a heart attack. There might be 900 people trying to get through at one time. It actually gets a stroke and the dial blows out. Believe it or not.
 

 I’ve had dancing dentists, singing lawyers, people who play the piano standing on their heads, cabdrivers who do handwriting analysis . . .. You name it, I’ve had it. And if I haven’t had it, I’ll create it.
 Yeah, yeah, Fred, let me play it now. Give me a buzz on Friday morning — I’ll make you happy. God bless you!
