 I’m here in Chicago and I have a female, died yesterday, and I’m in the process of positioning her.
I’ve been doing this for forty-one years. I just go from place to place — embalm the body, put the make-up on, put it in the casket — that’s all I do.
I’m shampooing her hair. Look how dirty it is.

Okay, now I’m going to raise the right common carotid artery.

I’m now cutting the esophagus.
If ma comes out looking like pa, well they’re not going to call me back.
Now I’m going to try to hit the heart, and there it is. I’m constantly, constantly clearing it.

When I go to parties, all of a sudden, I’m in the middle . . . Joe tell a story, well then by then I’ve got a couple of pops in me, a couple yakie-daks and I’m warming up. But see, I don’t want to do that. I want to hear their stories — but nobody wants to hear their stories, they want to hear these stories.
The whole trick is, when it stops leaking up here, at the carotid incision with the jugular — then that tells me I got the heart; it’s cleaned out.

I’m right in her throat in her . . . in to the tongue level.

Hear that?

Looks like we got her
I just do ’em. I just do ’ em — that’s all I know
What’s the best part of my job? . . . Closing my grip, that means — () ”Until we meet again, happy trails to you” () She looks wonderful.
