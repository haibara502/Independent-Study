Asma Jama (AJ):
 I wanted to reach out to you so much. I just wanted to know that you were okay. That was my biggest concern.
 That was my biggest concern too.
I used to be carefree. I used to go everywhere by myself. I would say hi to strangers. But after what happened to me, I felt like I had to look over my shoulder every time I go outside.
 I was so sorry you had to go through that.
 Did you stop talking to her because of what she did to me?
 I did, yeah.
 Why can’t you forgive her?
 Because then it’s telling Jodie that it’s okay. And it’s not okay.
Do you feel like you can’t speak Swahili in public anymore?
Yes, because I realized I don’t belong. I have to prove myself every single day and it makes me feel like I had to give up a lot of who I was.
 I’m going to pray that you can eventually become that person you used to be.
 I will get there. It’s going to take me a while. But for you to stand up for somebody you don’t know, and to say that what she did was unacceptable, that meant the world to me.
