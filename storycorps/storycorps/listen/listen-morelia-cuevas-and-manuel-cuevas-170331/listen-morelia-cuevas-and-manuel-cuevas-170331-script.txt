Manuel Cuevas & Morelia Cuevas :
 The guys at school were more about playing ball and the slingshots. That never interested me. I was really an outcast. I’d go to bed and I’d dream about fabrics and leathers and about the things that I’m going to make the next day.
 Do you have a general philosophy behind all this work that you do?
 Well, you know, a pretty dress is not necessarily a pretty dress, it’s the person that’s carrying that dress. I remember this guy wanted a John Wayne shirt, and the guy says, “I don’t see John Wayne in the mirror.” I said, “Neither do I. I can make you a John Wayne shirt, but I cannot make John Wayne out of you, you know.”
And I’ve always done only one piece. I don’t want to make two of anything. That’s why I don’t make socks. So it’s like history written again every day.
 So what would you say you’re most proud of?
 Well, I grew up in love with the Lone Ranger. And I was 5 years old walking 6 miles from the little town where I was born to the big towns to see the episodes of The Lone Ranger. And then as an adult, I got to make his uniform, his mask. That was the most glorious moment of my life.
 Would you ever think about retirement? [Laughter]
 Yeah, I retired this morning. I put new tires on —
 — [Laughter]
 No, I don’t. I don’t believe in that. I’m enjoying life and, and people keep giving me checks for it.
You know, if I was away from my shop, I probably wouldn’t be able to last more than 15 days.
The sewing machine and the needle and the thimble, that’s it for me, you know.
