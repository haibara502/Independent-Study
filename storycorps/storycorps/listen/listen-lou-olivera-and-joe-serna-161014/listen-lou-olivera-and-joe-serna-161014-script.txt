JS: In Afghanistan, it was me and three other guys on the truck, really good friends, and I had an accident where our truck flipped all the way over into a river, the water came in, and rose from the ankles to my waist, eventually to my chin, and it was pitch black. The only air we had was now filled with diesel fumes. My partner said, “I can’t feel my lips, I can’t feel my arms.” Then I heard him gasping. And I was the only survivor.
So I would have relived it over and over and over again in this cell by myself. It was confined space, no windows, and the door was solid, and there was just a small piece of glass you could see in and out, and that was it. 
 But I heard the door rattle. The jailer opens it up, and I see you coming in.
LO: You were sweaty, and you were shaking. You were wound tight.
JS: When you walked in, that all went away. And then when they locked the door, I thought to myself, .

JS: We had a long conversation–a lot of it was about our families–and I felt the compassion. 
LO: We all mess up, we all fall short—I am sometimes not the best husband, or the best father, or the best judge.
JS: Truthfully, that was the first time I ever opened up–to trust another person was a game changer. So thank you for being there for me, it means a lot to have someone in your position that understands.
