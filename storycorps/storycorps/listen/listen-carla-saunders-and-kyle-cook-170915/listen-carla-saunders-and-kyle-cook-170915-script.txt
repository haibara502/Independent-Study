CS: Summer 2010, we had six babies in the nursery who were in withdrawal.
KC: It was so hard to watch these babies—they would have tremors; they’re inconsolable. And we couldn’t fix it; we couldn’t make these babies better.
And little did we know that was the tip of the iceberg. We had ten, and then 15, and then, at one point, 37 babies in the NICU that were withdrawing. We were bursting at the seams
CS: We were completely unprepared and short-staffed. And I remember a nurse in tears holding a baby, and this baby is just screaming. And she said, “We have got to do something.” Because what we were doing wasn’t working. And here we were just a small children’s hospital—
KC: Mhmm
CS: —in east Tennessee. And these babies were carrying the flag of the substance abuse problem in the United States. And so we went looking to the experts, you know, ‘Let’s call across the country and let’s find out what’s the best way to treat these babies.’ And then that moment of…
KC: Nobody knows…
CS: …nobody knows.
KC: [laughs] And who knew that we would become the experts?
When you see a baby, especially one that has been in your care for a long time, that has been off the charts in withdrawal, and you’ve done everything you possibly can and you finally get this baby acting like a normal baby, and then he smiles at you—
CS: Mhmm
KC: —And to know that you’ve made a difference in a mother’s life—I mean, that will carry you through the darkest times, knowing that, my gosh, we did this.

KC: We did this.
