GENEVA TISDALE:: I put myself in my work, always have.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: I started off as a fountain girl.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: If she needed a glass washer, I washed glasses. If the sandwich board girl quit, she’d put me on the sandwich board — so I’ve been around.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: At first I thought it was — I said it was somebody being funny. I remember passing and I saw them sitting there and I kept walking. But then every time somebody would pass by them, they would ask if they could be served. They wanted — asked for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee. And everybody passed by them — just told them that they couldn’t serve them. So that made me kind of nervous, and I went on back to the back and I stayed back there.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: She said, ”Now you all go out, get dressed, walk around in the store like you’re a customer — shopping.” She said, ”Have your big bag and all.” She said, ”Walk around like you’re shopping and then come over to the counter,” and she told us where to sit — so we all did. She said, ”Now, if you don’t want your pictures in the paper, order something that you can eat real quick, ’cause when the word gets out,” she said, ” the newspaper people will be in here.” I ordered a egg-salad sandwich, and I swallowed it.  It took me about five minutes, I’m sure — no longer, no more than ten. And when we finished, we got up and left and she said, ”Go back upstairs, change back into your uniform, come back down and go to work and let’s see what happens.” So we done that. And sure enough it wasn’t long before the photographer and all was in — people started crowding in. And they didn’t know it was us.  We were the first.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: Just sit at the counter and be served.  That’s what I was hoping for.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: Five fifty. Five fifty.
ISAY:: 
TISDALE:: I feel like, sometimes, if a white person had this job, that person would get paid more than me. Just because of the color of their skin.
