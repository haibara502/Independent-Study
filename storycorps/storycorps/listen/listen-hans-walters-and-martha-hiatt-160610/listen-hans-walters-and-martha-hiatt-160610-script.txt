HW: When I was a kid only the really nerdy, reject kids loved animals and I was one of those kids. 
And my mother always encouraged my love for sharks. When I was 5, we were getting ready to leave the beach and lo and behold, there was a dead shark lying on the beach. And I said, “Mom, I wanna take the shark home.” So my mother helped me schlep thisthree foot shark into the backseat of the car. And I’m one of six kids and we all had our snow cones and the dead shark with the windows shut and it stank. <<laugh>> We all got sick. I remember upchucking my banana snow cone in the backseat of the car. 
So when I got to college I was studying marine biology and I’d sort of accepted my nerd-dom, you know? I think I had to play catch up in the interaction with members of the opposite sex department. Which is the main reason I joined a rock band. 
And we did pretty well for nine years. But at that point I was 30 and decided maybe it was time to find something else to do. That’s what led me to the New York Aquarium.
When I got there they would call the sharks Sand Tiger 1, Sand Tiger 2, Sand Tiger 3. And I just started calling them names of dirty, rotten, stinkin’ rock and rollers.
MH: <<laugh>> So you went with Guns N’ Roses…
HW: Yeah, this one’s Axl. This one’s Duff. And then we got another group of ‘em and we went with AC/DC. So there’s Guns N’ Roses and Bad Company are in one pool, and AC/DC and Janis Joplin are in the other. 
MH: I love when one of the keepers says to another, “OK, I’m gonna go feed Guns N’ Roses.”
HW: Or, “Who’s feeding the band?” 
<<laugh>>

MH: <<Laugh>>  So, your mom, she obviously knew you became a marine biologist. How’d she feel about it?
HW: She was thrilled. Her thing was, and she always said this from as long as I can remember, “Find something you’re interested in and stick with it.” That was it. Not, “Grow up, get a job and make a living.” — “Find something you’re interested in and stick with it.” And everything came full circle.
