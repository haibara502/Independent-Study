 Good morning. Day one. Walking to school. Leaving out the door.

 This is my dog, Ferocious. You know why he got that name if you hear him bark.

 I see the ghetto every day walking to school.
Some guys on the corner burning a fire. Be here summertime, wintertime, spring, fall — every day. With they drink in they hands. Probably some White Port, Willie P, Jack Daniels, E&J.
I live here. This is home.
 What’s up, Emmie? What’s up, Doodoo?
This is my walk everyday, so I’m taking you on a little journey through my life. Yes, my life. Yeah.

 

 Every morning I pick up Lloyd on the way to school. Today we’re ready to work — strapped with our tape recorders and microphones.

 Whassup?
You got the Tom Brokaw-look, lookin’ like Tom Brokaw. You got the Tom Brokaw, nigger, sit down.
 This is Lloyd Newman and I’m fourteen years old. I live with my brothers and sisters in the Ida B. Wells projects.
 Let me describe Lloyd. Lloyd is short. He weighs about 75 pounds. I have an inch between my fingers when I put them around his wrist. He got a head like a Martian.
 Alright, now let me talk about LeAlan. His belly take up his whole body.
 Like your head take up yours.
 We been friends since first grade.
 That’s seven years!
 Man — seven years of our life together.

 
: Liberty and justice for all . . .
: Be seated. No, no . . .
: Good morning Vietnam.
 Monday morning at 8:30.
 It’s kind of rowdy in the morning.
 Shante Hayes. Torrence Hinton. Absent. LeShawn Hunt. Absent. Uhh Terry Johnson. Absent.
 That’s Ms. Ford, our homeroom teacher. We give her a hard time.
 Fellas, would you please shut your mouths?
 Some times we learn. Most of the time it’s just too rowdy to learn.
 I can support myself. I can buy the things I want to because I learned to use my brain. Now lets try working on yours.

O.K., the sheets that I have been giving you so far . . .
 
 Is it hard being a teacher in this neighborhood?
 Yes, yes. It’s difficult. Not so much because the children are really any different. It’s difficult because of the publicity that surrounds the area. And you don’t believe that we believe you’re smart.
 
 

 

 You hear the nice music they’re playing?
 Yeah.

 Yeah, I’m from Ida B. Wells — what part of the United States are you from?
 Atlanta — actually Marietta I’m 29 minutes north of Atlanta.
 I know you played for the Sonics and you won the three point contest. What are some of your greatest achievements in life?
 Well, the biggest achievement, I think, is just being here for one.
 
 Math was always my favorite subject. It was always my favorite subject.
Thank you. Can I have your autograph?

: Goddamn. That was Dale Ellis man. That was Dale Ellis, man!!
 Dale Ellis, thank you.
 Dale Ellis from the San Antonio Spurs.

 
 Man, I’m tired.
 Who ain’t tired? I think I’m about to have a back-stroke carrying this stuff on my back!
 Okay, I’ll talk to you guys later. I’m out.


 My house, day two.
 LeAlan lives just a block away from me in an old house on Oakwood Boulevard. There are three houses attached to the side of his.
 One of them’s burned, and two of ’em just abandoned. And one of them, it leans over and keeps moving our house over to the side. When it get cold outside, it get cold in here. When it rain, the rain coming in. Whatever nature do, this house do. I’m in my front room now. How you doin’, Toochie?
 Okay.
 That’s my mother. Everyone call her ”Toochie.”
 Say hello, Jeri.
 Hello.
 My little sister, Jeri. I’m walking up the stairs.
 LeAlan’s grandma and grandpa live on the second floor of the house up a rickety flight of steps.
 Listen.  That shows you how rickety they are.
 
 This is still day two. It’s 12:06. Hello.
: Hello.

What we gonna talk about?
: We gonna talk about the neighborhood.
 How it changed and everything. How do you think it changed?
: For the worse. When we first came in the area there were no projects, there were all homes. And at one time we had nice hotels where different movie stars would come in and stay.
 When you start seeing a major change in the neighborhood?
: It wasn’t all of a sudden. It happened gradually: day by day, year by year. You could see the change when people would move out, or maybe the original owner would pass and their families didn’t want the building, and they would just go down.
 My grandma raised eight kids in this house. Her two oldest boys died. Now she has six kids.
: I have three boys and three girls. They all spoiled rotten. And so are the grandchildren, and especially you.
 Get you!

 What type of child was I when I was little? I was a whining child?
: No, you was a nice little red headed boy with the blue eyes.
I had blue eyes or brown?
: They was blue. They were lighter when you were young. And your hair was lighter. And it would turn white in the summer and darker in the fall.
 Well how was I named?
: You got your name from your two oldest uncles. Oldest boy’s name was Alan, and the second boy was Eric Lee, and your mother made your name out of the two names.
 Why she didn’t name me no common name? Why she have to name me a sentimental name?
: Because you’re different. Your name is different and you’re different.
 My name is LeAlan Marvin Jones.
: And she gave you the ”Marvin” for Marvin Gaye because she liked to hear him sing.
 My name is sentimental.
: Yeah, your name is special and you’re a special person, too.
 
: I think I been blessed, because things could have been a whole lot worse than they have been.

 How old are you?
 I’m eleven. I’ll be twelve this year.
 What do you think about your mother?
 She okay.
 You love her?
 Yeah. When she not drinking I love her. If she start drinking, I don’t.
 
 I been on medication, off and on, since 1977.
 
 One time, I had went downstairs, and it’s a long story, but I started seeing shadows on the back porch when I used to look out the window at night. And it looked like Ronald Reagan, and he was talking to my grandmother. And I was hearing voices. And the voices told me to get butt naked. I had did that before, too — taking my clothes off.
 What type voice are these? Are they a man voice, or a female voice, or just a voice?
 Just a regular little voice up there.
 Who is my father?
 Your father is a fellow named Toby Flipper. He say he know you exist. He seen you when you was about two. And I ain’t seen him since.
 What do you think happened to him?
 He probably dead.
 Thank you.
 Okay.


 Lloyd lives about two blocks from my house in the Ida B. Wells Projects. The Ida Bees are made up of about 3,000 units. Most of them are low-rise houses. A lot of them are in miserable condition.
 Now we walking in the Ida B. Wells. Which is 50% houses are boarded up. Now we’re going into my house. We’re knocking on the door.

Kicking on the door.

I hope she hurry up and open it.

Now we walking into my house.

 
 How did you react to it when you heard that she died?
 I was very upset. I just thought my life wasn’t worth living. I wanted to die, too. I just thought we wasn’t going to make it without her. But I see that we made it, and I’m very proud of us.
 Do you think it’s hard bringing us up at the age of twenty?
 Well, I’ll be twenty this year — I’m nineteen. But sometimes you all give us a tough time, but I love having you all as my brothers and sisters.
 
 My name is Michael Murray.
Lloyd’s brother: His name is ”Chilly Mac.” He’s at the liquor store.
 
 They gave me that name. I used to shoot pool, I used to hustle — any kind of way I could get some money.
 
 Spell ”food.”
 L-O-O-F . . . L-O-O-F.
 L-O-O-F?
: F-O-O-D.
 Wait — what did you spell? We said spell ”food.” What you eat.
 Oh, food. What you eat?
 Yeah, buddy boy, spell food.
 L-O-O-F?
 
: Me and her have fun, putting our feet in the water together. We were sober then — but once we started getting high, them memories gone. They gone.
 Why are you drinking?
 I don’t understand why I’m drinking.
 Do you think you going to stop?
 Yeah, I’m going to rehab, and take care of myself.
 What do you drink?
 I drink about two or three pints of wine a day. But it ain’t helping me, it’s only killing me. Don’t people understand its destroying you?
 If it’s destroying you, why do you still drink?
 That’s why I got to go into rehab, because I don’t want to destroy my family. I want my family.
 Do you think you’ve been a good father?
 Yes, I have. To the best capability I could.
 I have no further questions.


 

 
How the card game go last night?
 I won all the money! It was 80 dollars!
 Jeepers, how you be winning all the time?

 Man, what you want for breakfast — since you buying?
 
 Alright what else?
 
 Then with the omelet I want the hash browns and grits.
 Okay, now what about this French toast?
 I want the French toast with sausages.
 And I want the juice.
 Hold on a minute, just hold on.

 Man, that was one good breakfast.
 We just now got through eating at Johnson’s Restaurant.
 I ate twelve French toasts, two omelets.
 LeAlan ate the whole store up!
 Ooh man, I could eat again. My stomach starting to get hungry.
That’s all we do is eat, man, to tell the truth ain’t it — eat and talk. Let’s get on the bus man.

 
 
 
 There go the bus.
Yeah. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go! Let’s go!
 Hold that bus! Hold the bus! Hold that bus, please!

 
 What’s your favorite food — breakfast food, lunch food or dinner?
 Dinner food.
 This is what I be doing G. .

 
 I don’t see how them Chinese people go to school seven days out of a week.
 Man, there’s a couple of billion oriental people.
 ”Oriental.” Don’t you spell that ”O-R-I-E-N-T-A-L?”
 Think that’s right.
 ’Cause that’s the name of the Ramen Noodle — you know the noodles that we be eating?
Yeah, I love them. Oriental noodles — I be tearing them off when I be hungry.

 
 Hey girl, he say he like you. He say you attractive. He say it’s just that animal magnetism that just attracts him. Man, he say he love you.
 Uh uh — I just love you!

 Oh God. Oh God.


 

 We almost hit a car. Whew, that car came out we almost hit it. I think we did. No, we didn’t.
 If we would have had an accident, you think we would have gotten hurt?
 I would have sued — ”My neck hurt. I can’t move. Man I can’t move my neck.”

”My nose broke ohh.”
 Would you rather have a rubber nose or a plastic nose? I ain’t talking about the kind like Michael Jackson.
 A rubber nose, because if I have a fight they hit me it just bounce right off and hit them in they face.


 
 I’m out homes — I’m breathing and everything. I can hear everything. But I ain’t woke.
 
 It’s just a blessing that I made it back home.

 This is where the drive by took place last year, where the El Rukns shot down some folks right in this area where we walking now.
 Gangs and violence are just a way of life in this neighborhood.
 And now we see the Fort, where the Fort used to stand.
 
 We standing on the grounds now. You still see the caution police barrier.
 
 Gary! Slow up, man!
 
 I ain’t gonna be alive ten years, because selling drugs and shit they gonna pop my ass.
 

 

 
 
 
 





Now we walking towards the lake front.
 
 
 That’s a brother in there. Hit the white blazer. The white blazer. Throw it now!

 You just driving your car and — Poom! .We just hit the car. I don’t care about them people. Most of them going to the suburbs.
You be bored you do anything.
 Just to have some fun. Lloyd, come on, let’s stop running. All I know is I bust your windshield and you got an insurance claim — I don’t care about them people. Boy you didn’t think I was going to do it, did you?
 


 We back at LeAlan’s house.
 My sister back here asleep in her room. What time you got in this morning? You stupid! When the last time you been to school?

 About thirty or forty?
 Probably somewhere in that area. Maybe a little less than thirty.
 Do you know who killed or murdered these people?
 I know who killed some of them.

 He was wild, liked to stay out in the street all the time.
 He over there batting his eyes, acting like he sleeping. I see those eyes going, trying to find out what you thought about him.
 He go to work all day, and stay out in the street all night
 Didn’t he work at the cow company?
 Stock yards, he worked at the stock yards as a lugger — he would carry the cows on his back.
 A cow weigh 1500 pounds!
 He lug it. Hed carry half of it and put it up on the hook.
 How you carry them cows, granddad? How you didn’t get squashed?
: Carry the half of the cow.
How?
 On your back.
 That’s why we all got strong backbones, huh?
 Yup.
 
 Could you please sing that song for us?
 With my voice all messed up?
Do it. One, two, three . . .
: Do you remember when you walked among men? Well Jesus you know, if you lookin’ below, it’s worse now than then. They’re pushing and shoving, they’re crowding my mind. Lord, for my sake, teach me to take one day at a time. One day at a time, sweet Jesus, that’s all I’m asking of you. So help me today, show me the way, one day at a time.
 She was hoarse but she still can blow. Thank you.
