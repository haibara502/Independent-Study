 How do you guys feel about being triplets? Is it nice?
: Yeah, it’s really nice.
 Yeah, on the whole.
 The worst thing is we see each other every day, every minute of every day. So we can argue a lot.
 Yeah, and precisely because we know each other so well.

 Yeah.

 Yes it is.
 Sometimes.
 It’s just really helpful whenever one of us has a problem, like Nick’s really good at math and you’re really good at reading comprehension and stuff.
 We, we pool our —
 Resources.
 One of our greatest strengths is that our friends get extra friends because there’s the three-in-one package.
 But I’m a very quiet person on the whole. So I get kind of reserved and nervous when I’m meeting new people especially.
 Hmm. You’re a little bit of an introvert, you would say?
 Maybe.
 Have you ever felt that the house is crowded because you have two siblings, two parents, and three cats? And one cat in heaven?
 Not at all. Cats aren’t very substantial.
 Not really.
 I’ve sometimes felt that way. But since we’re getting new rooms in a couple months, we’re going to be all by ourselves. How do you feel about that?
 Mixed emotions.
 I don’t know how I feel. I’m kind of happy, but I always enjoyed having you two to talk to.
 Yeah, it’s going to be a hard transition for me, because I myself am not much for being alone.
 Yeah.
 And since I’ve had you all my life, I’ve had two other friends even when I didn’t have any friends. It’s really been nice.
