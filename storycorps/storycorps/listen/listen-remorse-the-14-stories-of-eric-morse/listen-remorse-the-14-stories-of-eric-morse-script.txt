A five-year-old boy refused to steal candy, so he was pushed from the fourteenth floor of a Chicago housing project . . .
A short life, a tragic death for five-year-old Eric Morse . . .
Neighbors say it was a horrifying sight . . .
Tonight the two boys, one ten, the other eleven, are charged with murder . . .
The cycle of kids killing kids seem to be escalating out of control . . .
Just when you thought you’d seen it all when it comes to juveniles and crime here in Chicago, now comes this . . .
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
PRESIDENT CLINTON:: What do you think about those two kids, ten and eleven years old in Chicago, that threw that five year old boy out the window? A five-year-old kid, who knew right from wrong, lost his life at the age of five because he wouldn’t steal candy.

JONES:: We are now standing at the site where Eric Morse, a young man that was threw from a fourteen-story window. Chairman Lane, this is fourteen stories. To a young person living in this community, I mean, it looks dead. You know, you have one abandoned building, it looks like, you know, a fourteen-story cemetery. If you lived in this community, and you were a young person, what would be your thought of living here?
LANE:: My thought would be it would be hell. And my thought would be, ’cause I am a dreamer, I’d dream all the time about green grass, and I’d be dreaming about playing basketball. And I’d be dreaming about going camping. But I certainly wouldn’t be dreaming about staying here, where you got to literally look over your shoulder every waking moment.
JONES:: We’re going to now walk upstairs to the fourteenth floor.

JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: We are now walking in.
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: We’re now entering the elevator. The elevator is not working.
JONES:: 
JONES:: Could you please tell me the story of Eric Morse?
LANE:: Eric was the victim of two young people who didn’t have anything else to do. Their fathers were both incarcerated. Mother . . .

JONES:: — w
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
JONES:: We’re on the fourteenth floor, and this is not a penthouse view. Right off in the distance you can see the Stateway apartment buildings. You see a liquor store. You see two or three liquor stores.
LANE:: And the other part of this view is you see — if you look at the young people who are on the street who basically have nowhere to go –they’re there now, and three hours from now they’ll be there. And that’s the difference between a healthy community: people in healthy communities have things to do, positive things to do; people in public housing have nothing to do.
JONES:: Excuse me, I want to bring some of the tenants in. ’Scuse me. What would be one thing you’d like to say to Chairman Lane of the CHA about living in these homes?
TENANT:: It’s just not a fitting place to really live. Look at the rats, how they runnin’ through here. I mean, not just mice, rats. In my apartment there I sit up in my bed and I watch rats just run over the floor, don’t give me no respect or nothing. Like I say, this is not a fitting place for a human being to live.
JONES:: Young man, young man! ’Scuse me young man. ’Scuse me, sir, what is your name?
SEDRICK:: Sedrick.
JONES:: How do you feel living in this community?
SEDRICK:: I don’t want to live here.
JONES:: Where would you like to live?
SEDRICK:: Anywhere except around here.
JONES:: What is so bad around here that makes you not want to live around here?
SEDRICK:: They be shootin’.
JONES:: How old are you?
SEDRICK:: Twelve.
JONES:: Twelve years old. Do you know about Eric Morse?
SEDRICK:: Yeah.
JONES:: Did you know Eric Morse?
SEDRICK:: Yeah.
JONES:: Do you know the kids that did it?
SEDRICK:: Yeah. Everybody want to beat them up.
JONES:: Did you feel that could happen to you?
SEDRICK:: Yeah.
JONES:: Do you know who this man is standing here? You know, he’s the chairman of all of this. What would you like to say to him?
SEDRICK:: Hi.

NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: Where you want to start? First to the top?
NEWMAN:: Top to the bottom.
JONES:: Right. All right. One vacant apartment, two vacant apartments, all these vacant apartments.

NEWMAN:
JONES:: Knock on the door.

TENANT:: Who is it?
NEWMAN:: Lloyd Newman with NPR. We’d like to ask you a few questions about Eric Morse.
JONES:: You sound like the lawman, you better chill it out. Gonna get a Mossburg in your chest.
NEWMAN:: We’re doing a story on Eric Morse, the young man thrown off a fourteenth-story window.
TENANT:: Honey, I don’t know nothing about that poor little child. I just heard about it. That’s all, baby.
JONES:: All right, thank you.
NEWMAN:: . . . 

NEWMAN:: Lloyd Newman with NPR, can we ask you a few questions about Eric Morse?
TENANT:: I’m busy right now, I don’t have the time.

TENANT:: Who?
JONES:: National Public Radio.

TENANT:: You doin’ what now?

TENANT:: No. Not interested in being interviewed.

JONES:: Man . . .

JONES:: Anybody home? Anybody home?
NEWMAN:: This whole floor abandoned.
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: Ghost town.
JONES:: 

JONES:: What was that yelling?
NEWMAN:: Man, Shorty fell from way up here.
JONES:: Way up here. Dog . . .
NEWMAN:: Way up here.
JONES:: Pshew.
JONES:: I wonder how he felt, falling from fourteen stories. What the hell would have been going through your mind?
NEWMAN:: I don’t know. I’d just be thinkin’ about how I’m gonna land and if I’m gonna survive. I’d be thinking about how it is in heaven. But I know I won’t have that much time to think.
JONES:: Man, I don’t know what I could have been thinkin’ about. I probably would have said a prayer or something. That’s all you could have said. God, forgive me for my sins. Amen.

JONES:: Since Shorty was so young, you know he went to heaven ‘cause, you know . . . Dude, you think they got a playground in heaven for them shorties?
NEWMAN:: Nope. Ain’t no playground in heaven for nobody.

JONES:: I don’t know, man. How you figure there ain’t no playground in heaven for little kids?
NEWMAN:: God didn’t make it special for nobody.
JONES: What Shorty gonna do up there? He wasn’t old enough to do nothing bad enough to go to no hell, so what could he do up there?
NEWMAN:: I got to think. He ain’t doin’ nothin’ up there.
JONES:: What he doin’, just kickin’ it? Or is he reincarnated or something. Maybe he a little bird or something.

JONES:: 


ISAAC:: Who is it?
JONES:: It’s LeAlan Jones.
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
JONES:: Hello. We’re doing a story with National Public Radio, and we wanted to ask you a few questions. How old are you sir?
ISAAC:: Thirty-seven.
JONES:: You thirty-seven years old. And you standing like 5’, about 4’ 11”. How old are you for real, sir?
ISAAC:: Eleven.
JONES:: Did you know Eric Morse?
ISAAC:: Yeah.
JONES:: Did you know the people that did it?
ISAAC:: Yeah. The boy who killed them — he was in my classroom.
JONES:: What type of kids were they? Were they very, very, very bad?
ISAAC:: Yes. When they used to go do bad stuff, I used to go.
JONES:: Used to go down there and steal?
ISAAC:: Yeah.
NEWMAN:: What were you stealing?
ISAAC:: I used to steal gold chains and a lot of stuff.
JONES:: Why did you want to run with that crowd?
ISAAC:: ’Cause when you, like, you don’t have nothing else to do, then you say you probably want to get down with them.
JONES:: 
JONES:: Is that a boy or a girl?
ISAAC:: A boy.
JONES:: Would you want that young boy to grow up just like you?
ISAAC:: Nope. I want him be a better person than me.
JONES:: Like make sure that his friends don’t die like that.
ISAAC:: Yeah, him too. Not just his friends, him too.
JONES:
JONES:: Can I speak to her?
ISAAC:: Tymeka!
JONES:: 
TYMEKA:: Them children didn’t just do this. You can’t tell me they did that. To pick a child up and throw him out the window? That is cruel, that is evil. An adult would do something like that, but not no children. Who that cruel?
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
TYMEKA:: I got next to him. And he’s not a terrible child. He’s not. He need some love.

SANDRA:: He just needed somebody to show him some guidance and some attention.
JONES:: 
SANDRA:: Ain’t no kid just born bad. A kid only grows to be what they see another person put in them. They can only put out what people put in ‘em. The only thing he knows is to kick other people around because that’s what he got when he was at home.

TYMEKA:: The person you think the dirtiest person, the meanest person in the world, got a side you can get to. You know?
You hungry? I fixin’ to go feed him . . . I need to eat myself.
JONES:: All right then.
JONES:: 
JONES:: When you look out this window, what do you see?
ISAAC:: Everything.
JONES:: You see good things?
ISSAC:: Yeah, sometimes. Like when I don’t see anybody out there selling drugs. That be good things, or if I don’t see nobody getting beat up or nothing.
JONES:: What’s the bad things you see when you look out this window?
ISAAC:: People getting beat up. Shot down. People going crazy.
JONES:: 
JONES:: Thank you, Isaac. You’ve been great, great, great man. And stay strong, man. Don’t let nobody get you doing nothing bad. All right?
ISAAC:: All right.
JONES:: Bye bye. Close the door.

JONES:: That show you how lonely these kids is, man.
NEWMAN:: Why, ‘cause they’ll talk?
JONES:: They just like goddamn M&Ms — they all hard on the outside, and all sweet on the inside. I mean, around here you can’t show that sweet . . .
NEWMAN:: You saw how he was about to cry?
JONES:: Yeah, I saw that. You ready to go? Let’s get this floor and get out of here.

JONES:: 

JONES:: Hello. Today we’re here with Kay Hanlon, the prosecutor for the Eric Morse case. How you doin’, Kay?
HANLON:: I’m doing very well thank you. How are you?
JONES:: I’m doing fine. We’d like to ask you . . . Do you remember what went through your mind when you first heard this?
HANLON:: The first thing I thought about was, I’ve been in juvenile court for almost two years, and I’ve seen some pretty horrible things, and the first thing that I could think about was that this was probably one of  most horrible things I’ve seen in two years. It was almost unbelievable. I always think that I’ve seen the worst thing that could happen to people, and you kind of just get on with it, and then this. And I was pretty shocked.
JONES:: Do you think this could have been a mistake?
HANLON:: No.
JONES:: Or an accident of some sort?
HANLON:: No. I don’t think so. Actually, I’m sure it couldn’t be an accident because of the way that it happened.
JONES:: Do you feel that these children were bred in a life of violence? ’Cause I live in that community and it seems to be getting worser and worser and worser every year. Do you feel that violence has bred violence into these children?
HANLON:: I certainly think that their backgrounds are different than a lot of other kids. I mean, anybody who commits this kind of crime probably has gone through something in their lives. But then again, I look at other kids, and like you’re saying, for example, you grew up in that community. Well, look what you’re doing. It’s a far cry from committing first degree murder. So I think it’s a part of it. It’s a piece of it that definitely that needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed long before I see these kids, because by the time they come to me and I have to prosecute them, the deed’s already done. The murder’s already been committed, so I think it has to start long before it gets to me.
JONES:: Okay, thank you, Mrs. Kay Hanlon, prosecutor of Eric Morse’s case. Thank you.

JONES:: 
DAVID HIRSCHBOEK:: These people that we represent are exposed to violence. They’re exposed to shootings. They see shootings, they see stabbings, they see everything.
NEWMAN:: 
HIRSCHBOEK:: There’s a history of violence that’s just so incredible. They see people being shot when they’re two or three years old. They’ve had relatives who have been shot or killed or whatever . . . it’s just . . . yes. Does that effect these children and is that what’s going on? I think that’s a big part of what’s going on.
JONES:: This is something I said many years ago. I said that these young kids . . . if you put their mind state at a young age with the mind state of a Vietnam veteran, they would have very much similarities.
HIRSCHBOEK:: What you’re saying is very apropos to what’s going on here. You talk about Vietnam. And there’s this whole history of traumatic stress syndrome.
HUTT:: But, you know the thing that I’ve noticed . . .
NEWMAN:: 
HUTT:: In all the time I’ve been here, I’ve never once seen a kid — and I’ve seen, you know, we get up to seventeen . . . I’ve seen a kid sixteen years, eight months, 6 foot 1, 190 pounds, carries a gun. His father’s incarcerated, his mother hasn’t seen him, and I’ve talked to the kids and within five minutes, and I see a little boy. A little boy starts talking to me. You’ve got little boys over there who never had a chance to be little boys. And I don’t care what they’re accused of doing, and how big and how mean they want to be, five minutes tops, you start talking to little boys. And every one of them — you can see it –they’re all savable. Every one of them, yeah.
HIRSCHBOEK:: I am not ready to relegate these people to the scrap heap of humanity, and I’ll fight it until the day I die.
ATTORNEY:: Without a doubt.
NEWMAN:: Thank you all.
ATTORNEYS:: Thank you.



JONES:: Let’s go.
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
PASSERBY:: You all rap?
JONES::  No, we can’t rap. We country singers. We sing country western music. 
DUDE:: You rap?
JONES:: No, I don’t rap. I’m talkin’ about, you know the little guy that got threw out of the window, Eric Morse?
DUDE #1:: Them kids. They have never been taught it don’t take much to kill a person, they be lookin’ at these cartoons. And they thought that this little boy couldn’t die.
DUDE #2:: Ain’t like Bugs Bunny. Go down and splash, and next scene he up there runnin’ around getting chased again.
DUDE #1:: They couldn’t have. A child can’t have the sense to where they’re going to push somebody out the window, man. Something had to go through them kids’ mind right then . . .
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
JONES:: I’m looking for that guy. You said Scuggs.
JONES:: 
JONES:: Excuse me, sir, what is your name?
MILLER:: Suggs Miller.
JONES:: What do you know about this Eric Morse story that you can tell the people that want to know?
MILLER:: Well, I’m the President at Doolittle West, the local school council, and the two young men that did it went to Doolittle, so I know them both actually . . .
JONES: 
MILLER:: I can remember when he was starting school in kindergarten.  came to school once with two bags of rock cocaine. Kindergarten. He gave one to his friend and he kept one. The friend swallowed his,  stuck his in his pants once the teacher saw them, you know. But these kids were, like, at that time five, six years old. Where did he get it from? Had to be in his household, you know. But when  was in school I could talk to him. He would flare up. He was very sensitive. You know he’d flare up and fight in a minute, but I could talk to him and he’d calm down and he would talk to me. And it just seemed like all he needed was someone to spend some time with him. When it happened it made me feel bad because I felt like I should have spent more time with him. We had, at Doolittle, tried to get help for him, and unfortunately we weren’t able to get it for him in time enough.
JONES:: All right, thank you.

JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: This is Lloyd Newman sitting here with . . .
ANTONIO ANDERSON:: Antonio Anderson.
CLINTON BROWNWELL:: Clinton Brownwell.
JONES:: 
ANDERSON:: I was with him.
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
ANDERSON:: Yeah, we was hanging out together. But I didn’t go upstairs with him. I stayed downstairs. Because I thought they was gonna take him over to somebody house. That’s why I stayed downstairs.
NEWMAN:: When they asked him to go up to the fourteenth floor, Eric didn’t know what was goin’ to happen, did he?
ANDERSON:: Nope.
JONES:: So you was with him right before it happened?
ANDERSON:: Yup. I was outside.
NEWMAN:: You saw him falling out the air?
ANDERSON:: Yup.
BROWNWELL:: Let me talk.
JONES:: 
BROWNWELL:: If he saw Eric Morse fallin’ out the air, he should have ran over there and caught him, dummy!
NEWMAN:: How you gonna catch someone falling from fourteen stories up?
BROWNWELL:: He still could have caught him if he fell. I would have caught him, and then if we would have caught him, his mother wouldn’t believe that he fell out the fourteenth floor window.
NEWMAN:: Did you see the body?
ANDERSON:: Hmm hmmm . . . He had blood on him.
JONES:: Was he alive?
ANDERSON:: Nope. He was dead.
NEWMAN:: Thank you very much.

NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
JONES:: You’re standing where somebody got killed, man. I mean that’s like walking over a graveyard.
NEWMAN:: Why it make you feel different to stand right here?
JONES:: It do, man . . .
NEWMAN:: Why, though? You ain’t standing on his grave or nothin’, you just standing on grass. It happened right here, but it ain’t right here.
JONES:: That’s like Indian burial ground, homey. You ain’t never gonna catch no Indian walking over another Indian’s grave, where he died or whatever, man. I mean, you never know. Shorty’s soul could be looking at us now, doing a story on him.
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: Excuse me, what is your name?
ANTONIO:: Antonio J.
JONES:: What is your relationship to Eric Morse?
ANTONIO:: He my cousin.

ANTONIO:: It make me feel bad. I cry every night when I go to sleep.
JONES:: What are some of the things that you miss about your cousin?
ANTONIO:: I miss how he used to play with me. He was my bestest one.
JONES:: Best cousin, huh?
ANTONIO:: Yeah.
JONES:: What did you do when you first heard that your cousin was dead?
ANTONIO:: I started crying.
JONES:: How long did you cry after Eric died?
ANTONIO:: About nine days.
JONES:: What made you stop you crying about it?
ANTONIO:: I just stopped watching the news, and I stopped crying.
JONES:: How old are you?
ANTONIO:: Ten.
JONES:: Do you know the guys that did it?
ANTONIO:: Yeah. He go to our school too and I beat him up about five times.
JONES:: You beat him up? For what?
ANTONIO:: For killing my cousin.
JONES:: What school do you go to?
ANTONIO:: Doolittle.
JONES:: How do they look at you when they find out you Eric Morse’s cousin?
ANTONIO:: They start picking on me, so I beat ’em up.
JONES:: So you just beat up everybody?
ANTONIO:: Yup. They always talking about him.
JONES:: 
JONES:: You know this is where your cousin fell?
ANTONIO:: There go his blood right there.
JONES:: Where?
JONES:: Come show us where his blood at.
ANTONIO:: Right there . . . under that window.
JONES:: You think you could just stay right here for about fifteen minutes and just think of Eric?
ANTONIO:: No.
JONES:: Why?
ANTONIO:: I don’t want to.
JONES:: You’ll be ready to leave, huh?
ANTONIO:: I’ll be ready to cry.
NEWMAN:: You’ll be thinking about him.
ANTONIO:: I’m gonna start crying, then I’ll start swinging.
JONES:: But you think violence gonna bring Eric back?
ANTONIO:: No, he ain’t coming back.
JONES:: 
JONES:: You see Casanova in school.
ANTONIO:: Yeah, I beat him up today.
JONES:: 
ANTONIO:: Casanova . . . Cas, come here.
NEWMAN:: That’s him?
ANTONIO:: Yeah. Cas, come on Joe. I ain’t gonna touch you.
JONES:: 
CASANOVA:: What?
JONES:: We ain’t gonna touch you. What’s your name?
CASANOVA:: Casanova.
JONES:: How old is you?
CASANOVA:: Nine.
JONES:: 
JONES:: You know what your brother did?
CASANOVA:: Nope.
LITTLE VOICE:: Out the window . . .
OTHER CHILD:: He know everything.
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: You know what your cousin did?
COUSIN:: Throw that little boy out the window.
JONES:: How old is you?
COUSIN:: Five.
OTHER CHILD:: They the same age.
CASANOVA:: Uh huh. He didn’t throw him the window. This is how it happened. At first my brother was going to throw him out the window, then . . .
NEWMAN:: 
CASANOVA:: His shirt was up over his head. That’s how it went.
JONES:: You think you gonna be like your brother?
CASANOVA:: Nope.
JONES:: Why?
CASANOVA:: Because I ain’t bad.
ANTONIO:: Yes you is. You be stealing out of Jewels.
JONES:: 
JONES:: What you take out of Jewels?
CASANOVA:: Candy.
NEWMAN:: What’d you steal for? What you steal for?
CASANOVA:: ’Cause I be hungry.
JONES:: Did you ever used to steal with your big brother?
CASANOVA:: No.
JONES:: Why?
CASANOVA:: ’Cause my brother didn’t like me hanging with him.
NEWMAN:: He didn’t? How old is your brother?
CASANOVA:: Thirteen.
NEWMAN:: How old is you?
CASANOVA:: Nine.
JONES:: All right, little Casanova. All right, Shorty.

NEWMAN:: 
GUARD:: I’ll pat you down.
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: 
JONES:: Where were you when you found out that someone was killed in your community?
JENKINS:: I was in Stateville, and I had heard it on the radio. And by me and my son being real tight, when you close to somebody you get a feeling, and when I heard it over the radio, you just had this premonition, you know. But we come off lock up, and I talked to his mother, and she was crying on the phone. But I had already knew. It was just that feeling — that gut feeling that you have, right.
NEWMAN:: 
JENKINS:: Warm. He’s sensitive. He’s understanding. He’s kind hearted.
JONES:: Do you feel that your absence led to the alleged incident?
JENKINS:: Yes, it did, because when a father and his child are separated, a child has the tendency to take the wrong route in life. And that happens to us all. You hang with the wrong peoples, eventually gonna happen, and this is what happened.
JONES:: 
JENKINS:: What happened . . . it was just dumb. Kids doing dumb stuff. You know, it’s not like they went and got a gun and shot somebody deliberately. It was not like that. This was kids doing dumb stuff.
NEWMAN:: What would you say to either one of your sons if you could see them right now?
JENKINS:: That I love them. And no matter what happened I’m there for you. So, just take it one step at a time. Because I’m always gonna be there for ’em. No matter what happen. No matter what happen.

TONI MORSE:: How you doin’?
JONES:: Fine. First I want to say thank you from my heart for you agreeing to do this interview with us. I’m just thankful. What is one of your fondest memories of Eric that just doesn’t leave your mind?
MORSE:: He’d tell a lot of jokes.
JONES:: He was a joker?
MORSE:: Yes, he was. Kept me laughing. Just always say little humorous things. I always think about him. Think about him everyday. He kept me smilin’ and laughing, and that just keep me going all in life, by thinking about him all the time. Just miss his little butt . . .
JONES:: I know you love your son very much. I can see that now, you know. Do you feel any animosity toward the parents of the young men, for allowing them to do such a thing?
MORSE:: I just feel sorry for ’em for not raising they kids like that. There have to be something wrong with anybody to do something like that.
NEWMAN:: What kind of future do you think the little children will have?
MORSE:: Not very much of a future.
JONES:: How do you feel towards the young men that did this?
DERRICK LEMON:: Bad.
JONES:: 
NEWMAN:: 
JONES:: If you had one more day to spend with your brother, what would you do?
LEMON:: Go swimming and play with him a lot.
JONES:: Where do you feel your brother is at now?
LEMON:: In heaven.
NEWMAN:: Is he still your little brother, or is he your big brother ‘cause he higher up?
LEMON:: Little.
JONES:: Little brother, huh? Another thing, Ms. Morse. How do you think Derrick’s life’s changed since the incident?
MORSE:: He do a lot of fighting now, something he ain’t never did. Tell him you rebellious. You like to fight people now.
LEMON:: Fight. Throw crayons.
NEWMAN:: You get your anger out by fighting?
LEMON:: Sometimes.
MORSE:: Maybe he’s lashing out. I don’t know. Probably he’s lashing out, because at a time he wouldn’t fight. Him or Eric. They would run from people.
NEWMAN:: Does he ever talk about his brother?
MORSE:: Of course he do. We always talk about him. I want him to talk about him for the rest of his life.
JONES:: If you had one more thing to say to Eric, what would it be?
MORSE:: That I love him and I miss him.
JONES:: Forever and always, huh?
MORSE:: Mmmh hmm.
NEWMAN:: Thank you.
JONES:: Nice meeting you. Thank you.
MORSE:: Thank you, too.
