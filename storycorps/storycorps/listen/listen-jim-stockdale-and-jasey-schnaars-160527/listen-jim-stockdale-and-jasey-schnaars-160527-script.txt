 At one point while dad was gone, mom decided that we would not take any family pictures. She just said it one night at supper and we nodded knowingly as if that made sense. And she decided that she would buy no new clothes until dad came home. There was also a point at which she decided that we should always have a small bowl of rice for supper and that’s all, to sort of share dad’s meager existence.
These sound like strange — they are, they’re, they’re emotional kinds of things that really indicated how desperate we were to do something, you know? How we might live our lives in waiting. 
I, I at one point visited a counselor, probably five years in. And the one piece of advice I remember was, “You may be better off just considering your father dead and gone.” Which, at the time, made pretty good sense to me. You know? After years and years of living with it. 
The day that dad came home we had been forewarned about dad’s injuries. But standing there on the tarmac, when he came down the a…came down the steps, I remember just holding his featherweight frame in my arms. We were just sort of stumbling over our love for one another. 

And we realized how close we had come. And, uh, we maintained a fierce, loving allegiance to one another through to the very end.
