Just once before I die
I want to climb up on a
tenement sky
to dream my lungs out till
I cry
then scatter my ashes thru
the Lower East Side

So let me sing my song tonight
let me feel out of sight . . .

A thief, a junkie I’ve been . . .

This concrete tomb is my home . . .

I don’t want to be buried in Puerto Rico . . .

So please when I die
don’t take me far away
keep me nearby
take my ashes and scatter them throughout the Lower East Side.
