HL: You perform the mission that you’re given. You do your job and then you either perform well or you don’t. 
BL: You say these things so matter of factly, like you’re talking about somebody else and yet you were there. 


HL: I have one really really horrible memory from Vietnam. It was in one of those times, you know, when the shit hits the fan. And in the middle of it one of the soldiers yells at me, “Behind you!”    
And I twirled around and I had an M16, and I saw this guy and I killed him. And it was after he was going down that it hit my consciousness that he had his hands up and wanted to surrender.
What we always did is looked at the bodies of the Vietnamese that we killed, ‘cause we’re looking for maps, papers, anything of intelligence value. But I didn’t go look at that body. You know when you’re out there and you go through pockets on a corpse and you pull out a little diary and you open it up, and it’s got a picture of a woman and a baby. You know…
Couldn’t do it.
BL: You were there during the worst of it, and yet you came home, at least to my way of thinking, perfectly normal.
HL: I mean, you talk about no impact, but, I can close my eyes and see that guy collapsing with his hands up. And I think about that kid often.
