JP: I remember you were on and off of drugs. There were times where we were missing half of the school year because there was nobody to make us go to school. But that was pretty short lived.
CP: I remember when the task force raided the house. You guys had gone off to school and I was in the bathroom getting high. I heard this bang bang at the door and the police were through and it just happened so quickly.
JP: The counselor called us from our classes and told us that we wouldn’t be going home. We were separated and put into different foster homes. We had black trash bags with a few of our belongings. I was afraid that I would never see my mom again. 
CP: My heart was breaking because I had been through that, I had been in 13 different foster homes. I knew that  desperate feeling of aloneness and fear. With my own childhood, I remember sitting in court with my mom telling the judge that she didn’t want me. And so, when I left the detox center, I was like, ‘Even if I don’t get them back, I’m gonna let them know that they’re worth fighting for.’ 
JP: I think that was the right thing to do. When you got custody of us, I was in 6th grade. 
CP: I wanted you guys back with me, but all that wreckage from your past, it never goes away. And there’s still always that fear, it was like, I don’t want to ruin my children’s lives. 
JP: But I did choose to come back with you. And things changed so much. Now it’s so amazing to see you with my daughter. She…adores you. 
CP: She’s just like a ray of sunshine. Big grin, with her little dimples that are just like yours. 
JP: I know. 
CP: Just being a part of your life and, you know, watching you parent. To me that means the world, to know that your kids will never have to go through what you went through.
JP: Growing up, I never saw myself as someone who could change things. And you know, now, I am doing that. 
CP: You are doing that. You’re giving them a good life.
