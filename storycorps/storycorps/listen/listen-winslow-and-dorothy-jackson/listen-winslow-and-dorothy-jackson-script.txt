Winslow Jackson (WJ): On my birthday, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis; three years later, my wife left, and we were divorced. And that was, undoubtedly, the saddest time of my life, because I felt so stranded.
Dorothy Jackson (DJ): I was almost 60, had the disease for over 30 years, could barely walk, and my husband died in a motorcycle accident. I was on my own. I was bewildered about where I was going or what I was going to do. But, one day, I was in the gym and this man, who invariably used my favorite piece of gym equipment, said…
WJ: ”Wow, nice red scooter.”
DJ: I thought, well, I’d heard lines like this before, but this time it was different. We talked for 15 or 20 minutes. And I found out that he also had MS.
WJ: So, we dated–oh, let’s say maybe a year and a half–and the question came up, ”Well, how can two people with MS ever survive together?” And this has been the real miracle of our relationship.
DJ: If one of our scooters goes down, the other one can pull or push…
WJ: I’ve pushed her many times [laughs].
DJ: …and I’ve pulled you!
WJ: Well, true. Fortunately, today, they have medications out that can almost stop the progression of MS. So, my symptoms have not really changed in the last ten years. I certainly am very hopeful that my wife will not worsen either.
DJ: We’d like to think that we’re setting good examples of how to live life.
WJ: Well Dorothy, I want to thank you so much for being with me and being my true love.
DJ: You’re so much fun to be with. I look forward to continuing to seeing the world with you.
