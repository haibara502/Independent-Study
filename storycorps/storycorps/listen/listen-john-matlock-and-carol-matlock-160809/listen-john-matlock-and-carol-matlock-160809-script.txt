 You could have paid for just a year or two years. But I paid for life.
 I don’t remember how in the heck I joined, but I was kinda lonely.
 You were in electronics, which was what I was working in, and that’s how we were matched together.
 Yeah. I got a packet from them which included pictures of three different ladies, and yours was one of them. I looked it over. I did call one of the girls. Was not successful in getting a date with her. I don’t know what her case was… But then I called and talked to you.
 After we had several dates, I called the dating service, and said, “You know, I don’t think you need to send any more calls and he doesn’t want any either.” I said, “I think that we’re for each other.” But you didn’t know I did this….
 Uh-huh.
 Uh-huh. 

 I wondered why the well ran dry.
 That’s all I cared about, it worked. 
 I asked to adopt him, and he carries my name.
 To me that was the most important thing. And we’ve been together 52 years December of this year.
 And who would’ve thought enrollment in a computer dating service
 Would lead to this …
 Would’ve worked out to that.
 We’ve had a wonderful life together.
 Yes, we have.
