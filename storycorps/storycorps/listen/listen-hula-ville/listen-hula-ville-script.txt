 What are you doing, shooting some gaff here?
 No, what I’m doing is I’m doing a radio story about you.
 You are?
 If you don’t mind.
Not at all.  That’s a big laugh. 
 
 Well, uh, I’m not dead. 

 This here I built myself — all of this.
 Can you give me a tour?
 You bet I can. We’ll walk through my place here.
 
 If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here.
 
 Oh, I’ll tell you how I picked this spot. I was out…
 
 It’s an attraction.
 
 You see how tall that Joshua tree is? That’s something that nobody ever saw in all their life, and if you can find one and bring it here, I’ll give you a hundred dollars.
 
 What does that say there?
 America new fashion. Stomach comes first.
 Oh, for gosh sake.  I didn’t even know that was there. Stomachs…
 
 Some of these are funny. What does that say?
ISAY: It says, ’During thunder and electrical storms, discontinue play and return to the clubhouse.’
 
 Where’s the clubhouse?
 Oh, the clubhouse is–the clubhouse…Uh, back there.

 We’re in number one. Here’s where you tee off.
ISAY: I don’t quite see how this is a golf course. It just–
 Well, they have them now, miniature golf course. They’ve got ’em all over now–miniature golf. They got two up here.
 But there are no holes.
 They have grass now. I don’t have the grass.
 But there are no holes, Miles.
 Well, no. They like it this way. Then they don’t have to stoop down there and wear themselves out. They just kick it. It’s more fun.
 The Religious Shrine, 
 The resurrection of Jesus.
 You don’t find that on every golf course.
 No, you don’t.  You don’t find me either. 

 Here we have a poem called .
 Yeah, we did? I didn’t know that was in there.
 Yea so welcome are all of thee / To this museum so full with glee / Here are a host of signs you may see / So cleverly painted by old Mile-zee. That’s you, huh?
 Yeah!
 And so this dream will always be / A haven of peace for you and me / From a tired world you’ll be free / To behold bottles before you flee
 Well I’ll be damned. I wrote a lot of poems, but that is about as good as I can write.
 
 Well, goodbye and good luck.
 Thank you Miles. It was great to meet you. It was a pleasure.
 Well, it’s great to meet you. The greatest pleasure I ever had. You stop here the next time you come. Will you do that?
 Sure. Bye bye, Miles.
 Bye. I’m going to sit down again. What’s your first name?
 David.
 David.
