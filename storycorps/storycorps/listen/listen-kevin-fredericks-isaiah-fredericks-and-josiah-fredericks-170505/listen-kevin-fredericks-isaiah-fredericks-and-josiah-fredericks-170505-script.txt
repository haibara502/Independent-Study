 When and where were you born?
 I was born in El Paso, Texas in 1983 on my grandmother Ruthie’s bed.
 Interesting to know. I did not know that.
 [Laughs]
 How do you describe yourself as a child? Were you happy?
 I was a very happy, curious child. There was a lot of playing outside in the hot sun and drinking water from hoses.
 You drank water out of hoses? Man, I am learning so much new stuff about you.
 [Laughs]
 What’s the hardest thing about being a dad?
 The hardest thing about being a dad is having a drink that you want to drink, and small people put their nasty mouth all over it. And then whatever they were eating is now in the drink, and then you don’t want it anymore. Or buying them food and they don’t want their food but they want your food. You’re just never satisfied.
 Why can’t I be in charge?
 Because then everything would be a nightmare.
 Because you are missing four teeth and no one’s going to listen to somebody who doesn’t have teeth in their mouth.
 [Laughs] Why can’t I be an animal?
 You have to take that up with your creator.
 Why can’t we own a roller coaster?
 [Laughs] We can own a roller coaster, we just don’t.
 Okay, then let’s do.
 [Laughs]
 Why do things rhyme?
 How’s he supposed to know that?
 [Laughs]
 Why can’t we have a van?
 [Laughs] Why can’t we have a van? Why are you asking these questions? Why do you want a van?
 [Laughs] Why can’t I be more like you?
 What do you mean?
 I know I look like you, but more like you.
 Because you’ve got to be yourself, man. Follow your own path and enjoy being a kid. Being an adult is not as fun as it looks. Enjoy having nothing in your pockets, and no keys, and somebody else being responsible for buying all your food. Because one day you’re going to look up and say, ‘Man, I had it so easy.’ Who cut the peanut butter sandwiches in your life? I did! I cut hundreds and hundreds of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. [Laughs]

 Are you proud of me? Me! Not him.
 [Laughs] I am very proud of you. You’re both fantastic children and I am happy and proud to be your dad.
