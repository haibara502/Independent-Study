RE: :A sheriff and two plainclothesmen barged into the house and searched for what they called contrabands. They took out my brother’s box camera, my father’s short wave radio and they took the axe to it and chopped everything up. My father never protested. Never said a word. He just stood there.

AE:. :ome months later we were put into campsDo you remember those times?
RE: :I do remember getting on these Army trucks. I was probably five or six years old. I thought I was going on a vacation.
AE: :Did you know that you were not going to return to your house again?
RE:: No. I was 8 years old. And I really didn’t understand what this all meant and how it would affect our family. I guess I felt we were guilty of something, but what I didn’t know.


AE:: Yeah. We regret it very much. 
RE:: You know, I just feel that I want to go back and accept that pride — that pride of who we are.
