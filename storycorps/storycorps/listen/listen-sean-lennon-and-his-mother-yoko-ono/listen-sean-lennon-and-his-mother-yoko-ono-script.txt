Yoko: Well, probably, but you know the thing is, my mother was a beautiful, beautiful woman from a very rich family, and my father, that just upset him, you know?
Sean: So he felt sort of, insecure a little bit?
Yoko: But you know what happened? So my mother didn’t mean it badly, but, a chauffeur would take him to the bank every morning. He said ”I don’t want to do that because they’re going to see me, in the Rolls Royce.”
Sean: That’s so funny because remember I would really be upset when you would make me go to school in a limo.
Yoko: Yeah yeah yeah, I know. So the thing is, he insisted that the car would stop two blocks from the bank.
Sean: That’s exactly what I did remember?
Yoko: And he walked…
Sean: Wait, but do you remember, I would make the, well maybe you don’t know but I used to make the limo driver stop two blocks from my school so I could walk to school because everyone else took the bus, and you wouldn’t let me take the bus. Because it was a dangerous time — 
Yoko: Dangerous time.
Sean: –a lot of people trying to like kidnap me and stuff.
Yoko: I know. 
Sean: But it’s just funny that I had the exact same experience. 
Yoko: Isn’t it amazing? So it’s probably kind of like a DNA memory or something. Isn’t that interesting? 
Sean: Yeah. Well, that was a really fun talk mom, thank you so much. I wish more interviews were like that.
