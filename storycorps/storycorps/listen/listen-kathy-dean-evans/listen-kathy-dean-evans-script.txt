KDE: :All of the television shows were interrupted and the bulletin came across the TV and I remember all of the neighbors on our block ran out of the house and into the street. And there was disbelief and shock and people crying.
A day or so after that happened I remember I was standing at the window peering through the blinds, and these huge national guard tanks were rolling down the street, and I could not move I was so frozen with fear. Our neighborhood was so safe and loving and kind, and to have these huge tanks with national guardsmen rolling down our streets was such an invasion. I still think about that time. I think about me as a little girl, so frightened that I couldnâ€™t move.
