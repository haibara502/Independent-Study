Andy (A): What were your feeling when you first saw me in the airport?
P: Oh my God, I was like, all of a sudden I start clapping and jumping, saying ‘ahlan wa-sahlan’ — ‘welcome, I’m so happy to see you.’
A: You’ve been here for three years. What was the hardest thing to adjust to in the U.S.?
P: As immigrant who come from completely different culture, you’ll see the people here, like, most of them are nicely, friendly and they respect your religion, your background.
A: Mhmm.
P: But, you know, I work as a caregiver in a senior home. So one day, one of my residents he start calling me racist names. But we start talking and one year later he said, ‘I’m sorry. Philip, you changed my mind.’

hen I remember my last couple years, like working by myself here — I used to work like four different jobs — and at the end of the day, go home, there is no one waiting for you.
A: Yeah.
P: That’s hard feeling.
A: Yup.
P: So from being alone to a whole family with my best friend and nephew with me.
P: What do I need more…
A: Yeah…
