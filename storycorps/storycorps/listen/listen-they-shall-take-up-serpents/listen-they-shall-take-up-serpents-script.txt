DAVID ISAY:: 
DEWEY CHAFIN:: I’m Dewey Chafin, 59 years old. Been handling serpents 32, 33 years . . . 34 . . . and been bit 115 times. And I’ve never seen a doctor for it.
ISAY:: That’s a lot of bites.”
CHAFIN:: Yeah, and a lot of hurt.
ISAY:: 
CHAFIN:: Right now you’re in rattlesnake country, and you can find them anywhere in these weeds.
ISAY:: 
CHAFIN:: What’s the matter?
ISAY:: 
CHAFIN:: I got him. Not too big, but that will kill you.
ISAY:: 
ISAY:: You sure do know how to have fun, Dewey.
CHAFIN:: Well, I think it’s fun.
ISAY:: 
CHAFIN:: Why I do it is because the Bible said to do it. And that’s just the bottom line.
SINGER:: They call us snake handlers well that’s all right. They call us snake handlers well that’s all right. As long as you live in holiness well that’s all right. They say we going crazy well that’s all right. As long as we live in holiness well that’s all right.
ISAY:: 



RAY MCALLISTER:: No gossip. No lying. No backbiting. No bad language. No tobacco.
ISAY:: 
MCALLISTER:: No women cutting hair, jewelry, or makeup. No men with long hair, mustache or beard. . .
ISAY:: 
CONGREGANT: (to Mcallister): Hello, Ray!
ISAY:: 
BOB ELKINS:: I guess it’s about time we got started.. These serpents are new serpents and we’re not responsible for anybody that gets bit. If you handle them you handle them on your own, if you get bit you get bit on your own. Let’s everybody pray at this time.
ISAY:: 




BELIEVER:: Sometimes I feel like my hair is standing on my head. Sometimes I want to run, sometimes I want to dance, sometimes I want to cry, sometimes I want to laugh.
ISAY:: 
ELKINS:: You’ve got to do what the word said. Not talk about it, but put it in action.
ISAY:: 
ELKINS:: And there ain’t too many people who want to put their life on the line for the word.
ISAY:: 
ELKINS:: ”And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.”
ISAY:: 
BELIEVER #1:: In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues . . . ”
BELIEVER #2:: They shall speak in new tongues . . .”
BELIEVER #3:: They shall take up serpents . . .”
BELIEVER #4:: They shall take up serpents . . .”
BELIEVER #5:: Serpents . . .”
BELIEVER #6:: Serpents . . .”
BELIEVER #7:: And if they take drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.
BELIEVER:: My children take up serpents and I worry, because I’m a mother, but I can’t tell them not to do that because I’d be telling them not to obey the Lord. See you can’t hide anything from the Lord. If I sit here and told you that it didn’t scare me it’d be a lie, because God knows it does.
ISAY:: 
BETTY JOHNSON:: He believed it, he lived it, and he died for the word.
ISAY:: 
JOHNSON:: He never once asked ’Why?’ He never complained about the pain, and I know he’s in a better place right now than I am.
JEFF HAGERMAN:: The Bible says every man’s got an appointed time to die, if it’s driving a car, handling serpents, or sitting here talking to you.
ISAY:: 
HAGERMAN:: They thought that if they caused me a little trouble I might get out of it. But I ain’t going to hell for nobody.

ISAY:: 
SHERRY:: When you love somebody, you don’t want to see them doing things to get hurt, and anytime somebody that you love, you see them endangering their life, your automatic instinct is to try to keep them from endangering their life.
BROTHER:: It’s like playing Russian roulette, they’re just playing it with snakes.
SHERRY:: It’s the same thing. I say here’s a gun, it’s got one bullet, let’s see which one is going to die today. And it’s crazy.
ISAY:: 
STEVEN:: It’s like a super high. It’s the adrenaline of reaching down and picking up a snake, and knowing that you could get bit. It’s like living on the edge. You know you could die at any second — the adrenaline is going through your body so fast it gives you a super high.
ISAY::
STEVEN:: One weekend he got bit — it was a Sunday evening he got bit — twice with a copperhead, one on each hand. Monday morning they called me, told me Jeff was bit. So I went straight up there, and I told my wife Nancy when I went in, I said, ”You hold the door open when I go in, because I’m gonna take him out.”
Jeff told me he was going to kill himself, he would kill himself if we just take him to the doctor and I believed him. So I said, ”Alright Jeff, I’m not gonna force you to go, but it ain’t gonna happen no more.” He said, ”What do you mean by that?” I said, ”Just what I said — it ain’t gonna happen no more.”
ISAY:: 
STEVEN:: They took us to jail. The following weekend same thing, and the following weekend we took some more snakes, and every time we went up there and took the snakes we went to jail.
ISAY:: 
STEVEN:: If I thought it would get him out of the church I’d go to jail tomorrow.
ISAY:: 


GENEVA:: The first time I seen it I ran outside the church and cried like a baby. It’s not a good feeling.
ISAY:: Is it hard for you not to call a doctor?
GENEVA:: Oh yes, yes.
ISAY:: 
GENEVA:: I thought he was gonna die, and so did he.
ISAY:: What did that do to you?
GENEVA:: Knowing he was hurting and there was nothing I could do? I don’t really know. Love him more, I suppose.
SINGER:: I’ve walked with my Lord through sunshine and darkness. I’ve walked everywhere in the light of his love. Temptations are great, but God’s love is greater. God knows all about us, yes, my God understands.
ISAY:: 
WILLIE MCCOY:: My nickname used to be ”Wild Willie McCoy.”
ISAY:: Why did they call you that?
McCOY:: Because I was wild. I’d just as soon to bust your head as to look at you, but I have no desire to hurt no one no more. But I did, I carried a gun or else I carried a machete or a knife, it didn’t matter. You looked at me crossways I’d straighten it up. So I was a soldier for the devil. Now I’m on the battlefield for my Lord, and I’m going to serve him.

ISAY:: 




MCCOY:: You know the Bible said some would lose their life for the gospel sake, some would be cast into prison. So when you look at things really the way they are, it’s a fulfillment of the Bible. So if anything that makes my faith stronger!
SINGER:: Well they put old Paul in prison, long about the midnight hour. He began to call on Jesus, Jesus sent him power. King Jesus, Lord know you’ll hear me when I pray. For I’m down here in trouble Lord, send an angel by my way. Well you want to take up serpents, and you got just a little bit of fear. Just call on my Jesus.
ISAY:: 
PASTOR:: Now they’s some serpents up here. If I count right, there’s about four boxes. And I’ll tell you boys, they aren’t empty. And the serpents ain’t empty either. They don’t have their fangs pulled. They don’t have the poison milked out of them. Amen.

ISAY:: 
BELIEVER:: It paralyzes your joints, but it ain’t supposed to hurt you. If it hurts you, there’s something wrong. It ain’t supposed to hurt you.
ISAY:: 


PASTOR:: In his name they’ll cast out devils. They’ll speak with new tongues. They’ll take up serpents. They’ll drink the deadly thing. They’ll lay hands on the sick and they’ll recover.
ISAY:: 
BELIEVER #1:: If man could have written that part of God’s word, he could have written any of it. And if I doubted that part of God’s word, then it’d give me a reason to doubt the rest of it.
BELIEVER #2:: A lot of people say ”Well, you interpret it wrong.” I hadn’t got but one way to interpret it, and that’s read it for what it says.
BELIEVER #3:: They say, ”Well, that’s not what it means.” Well, what does it mean then?
BELIEVER #4:: It meant what it said, said what it meant, and if it didn’t say what it meant, why didn’t it write what it did mean?
BELIEVER #5:: We either believe it or we don’t believe it, and if we believe it we’re going to do it.

ISAY:: I’m David Isay.
SINGER:: They call us snake handlers well that’s alright. They call us snake handlers well that’s alright. They call us snake handlers well that’s alright, as long as we live in holiness well that’s alright.
