VOICE 2:: If you don’t believe in God you shall be lost. You shall be roasting on your roaster while you’re toasting on your toaster as you’re coasting on your coaster. The devil’s gonna baste you like a Butterball turkey.

SANDLER:: 

MAN:: Can I give you a gospel tract, sir? Can I give you a gospel tract ?
SANDLER:: What is it?
MAN:: It’s a gospel tract. It tells about Jesus Christ and how he died and rose again.
SANDLER:: What group do you belong to?
MAN:: I don’t belong to any group. I’m just saved. God sent me up here to preach the word of God and give out gospel tracts.
SANDLER:: Now where have you come from?
MAN:: North Carolina.
SANDLER:: Uh huh. And how come you came to Times Square?
MAN:: This is just where I felt led that God would have me to come.
SANDLER:: So God told you to come to Times Square.
MAN:: Yeah.

PASSERBY:: Oh, thank you very much.
SANDLER:: I’ll catch you later.
MAN:: Can I give you a gospel tract . . .

SANDLER:: 

PREACHER #1:: Television is really . You’ll have a lot of time in hell to think about the Dave Letterman show. You’ll have a lot of time in hell, you’ll have eternity in hell . . .
SANDLER:: 
PREACHER #2:: And God’s got a final say on this. They will have their part in the lake of fire.
SANDLER:: 
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: America is not a Christian country. If it was, there’d be no bars, there’d be no liquor stores, there’s be no abortion clinics, there’d be no homosexual parades in California, New York, Chicago, and Washington.
SANDLER:: Are you guys going to be out here in the middle of the winter?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: The beginning, the middle, and the end of the winter. Every day, as usual.
SANDLER:: Preaching the word, right?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: Preaching the word.
SANDLER:: You guys are dedicated.
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: Thank you.
SANDLER:: What do you do for money?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: I work for the government. Post office.
SANDLER:: When do you work?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: From 7: 00 to 3: 30.
SANDLER:: And then you preach?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: Yeah, on my lunch hour and now, yeah . . .
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: There are so many different Gods out there for man: a Hindu God, a Muslim God, a Christian God, a black God, a white God, an Indian God, a Chinese God . . .
SANDLER:: How many God’s do you think are out here in Times Square?
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: Well, you got the God of money, you got the God of sex, you got the God of adultery, the God of crack. I remember in the ’60s when they used to write ”Eric Clapton is God” — Eric Clapton, the singer for Cream. And now he’s on his own.
SANDLER:: Well the Beatles said they were bigger than Jesus Christ.
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: And the Beatles — John Lennon said that the Beatles are more popular than Jesus Christ.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE PREACHER:: But who was the first Beatle to die?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE PREACHER:: And he wasn’t even old!
POST OFFICE PREACHER:: But the first Beatle to die was John Lennon. And the Beatles, just before they broke up they said, ”All you need is Love.” But what happened to the love in the Beatles group? We learned that the Beatles just before they broke up they started hating each other . . .

KOREAN MAN:: Ladies and gentleman , the Judgment Day is coming. Repent. Repent . . .
SANDLER:: 
KOREAN MAN:: 6-6-6 . . . 6-6-6 . . .

KOREAN MAN:: Yeah, October . . .
SANDLER:: October 28th, 1992.
KOREAN MAN:: Sure, hallelujah. Yeah.
SANDLER:: But it didn’t happen.
KOREAN MAN:: No, no. Jesus came already in the heaven. In the air. Heaven.
KOREAN WOMAN:: In the air . . . but you don’t see. You don’t see.
SANDLER:: But I heard your group sold all their property, took their kids out of school, went back to Korea, sold everything . . .
KOREAN MAN:: All over the world, October 28th!
SANDLER:: But it didn’t happen!
KOREAN MAN:: A few people saw. Not many people. Only a very few. Only a few people. Okay? Okay?

HEBREW ISRAELITE #1:: They shall surely be put to death.
HEBREW ISRAELITE #2:: You shall be put to death, you so-called white man, and you black men too. The scripture tells you to stop following this white man! Come out from amongst him!
SANDLER:: 
 they

HEBREW ISRAELITE:: Get ready white boy, you next! You next! George Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher — all you white people, get ready for war! We’re coming for you white boys! Ku Klux Klan. Get ready for war! We coming for you, white boys! Negroes are the real Jews! Get ready for war, white boy. You want to get on your knees right now?
SANDLER:: No.
HEBREW ISRAELITE:: Well, get the hell out of here!
SANDLER:: 
HEBREW ISRAELITE:: You so-called white man, you had over 400 years to extend your hand to the world, and share this kingdom with everybody, but you wasn’t meant to do that. You was set up to be the devil on earth. I take my hat off to you. You did a good job. You did an excellent job of being evil and wicked and perverse and deceiving and deceptive. Love is going to be brought here by Christ when he destroys you and he puts you in slavery. That’s the love that Christ is talking about . . .
SANDLER:: 
SANDLER:: Sir, can I ask you a question? Tell me about your experience right then and there, okay, when you were laying down on the ground.
MARTYR:: For me it’s like . . . I’m just not going to hate anybody. It’s beyond me. I dislike the hatred and the rage, because it’s just not a good thing. I can’t see why people have to hate.
SANDLER:: What are your religious beliefs?
MARTYR:: I have no real . . . I just believe in God. I have no fundamental religion.
SANDLER:: What is your work? What do you do in life?
MARTYR:: I’m unemployed at the moment. I don’t have a job. So . . .
HOMELESS MAN:: You have a quarter? Ain’t nothing in there.
MARTYR:: There you go. That’s all I got guy, I’m sorry. But . . . I just say I’ve got to forgive them. If people want to hate me because of what my forefathers did, so be it. If people want to take my life, let them, if it makes them feel better. I’ll just ask God for forgiveness. See you later.

SANDLER:: What’s going on?
RUSSIAN PREACHER:: Is coming Jesus soon for judgment. When you don’t repent you go to hell and fire. Judgment Day is coming soon. Judgment Day. You must repent.
SANDLER:: I’m Jewish though.
RUSSIAN PREACHER:: That’s your problem.

SCIENTOLOGIST:: Hi, have you read this book?  is a good book!
SANDLER:: 
SCIENTOLOGIST::  will improve you.  gets rid of problems of unwanted things about yourself.
SANDLER:: And what’s been your own experience?
SCIENTOLOGIST::  has improved my ability to communicate with people, my self-confidence, and my certainty.

SCIENTOLOGIST:: Yeah, I’m certain about everything.
SANDLER:: You’re certain about everything now?
SCIENTOLOGIST:: Everything that I know.
SANDLER:: What are you not certain about?
SCIENTOLOGIST:: What I don’t know.
SANDLER:: What don’t you know?
SCIENTOLOGIST:: What I don’t know I don’t know and I know what I know.
SCIENTOLOGIST #2:: He’s our best book salesman.

WANDERING DERVISH:: I don’t want to say it but you’ve met a wandering dervish. Religion in Times Square – please! We don’t need religion, we need truth and love. Ahandelea. May the blessings of the creator of the universe be bestowed upon everybody in Times Square.

RANTER:: God says killers go to hell!
SANDLER:: 
RANTER:: You’ve got to think of this before you kill your very own baby!
SANDLER:: 
RANTER:: Abortionists, why did not your mother kill you?
PASSERBY:: Is he out of his mind?
SANDLER:: What do you think?
PASSERBY:: I don’t know sort of. He’s not normal.
RANTER:: Homosexuals, God gave you AIDS. God says homosexuals are to be put to death.  20: 13.
SANDLER:: I think a homosexual experience would do you a world of good.
RANTER:: You make it a carnival: homosexuals filling Sodom and Gomorra. Look at ’em — the filth, the scum of the earth. That’s why God kills you idiots with AIDS.

SANDLER:: 
SANDLER:: Do you realize you people are playing in the shadow of a billboard advertising homosexuality. See that up there? The Benetton Ad? That’s two guys intended to be in an amorous relationship. What do you guys think about that?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: What do I think about it? I don’t agree with it.
SANDLER:: Why would God have created homosexuals in his grand plan?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: God didn’t create homosexuality.
SANDLER:: You don’t think so?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: I believe man created homosexuality.
SANDLER:: But didn’t God create man?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: Yup.
SANDLER:: So God sorta knew it was gonna happen. If God knows everything . . .
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: That’s the sin of the world.
SANDLER:: Maybe everything’s okay with God, maybe everything that happens is okay with God and there’s like nothing wrong, you know?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: No, I don’t think so.
SANDLER:: But what if we had a vision of a positive God that tolerated everything, that was compassionate, and didn’t really have a problem with what humans want to do?
SALVATION ARMY MUSICIAN:: Actually, I do think we have a God who is very tolerant of us. He’s so tolerant, he doesn’t destroy the earth for what we do.

SANDLER:: 

SANDLER:: 
STUTTERING MAN:: I don’t think Christ w-w-w-ould talk like that.
SANDLER:: 
STUTTERING MAN:: Too much arguing and too much debating and too much arguing. I don’t feel-feel-feel that Jesus Christ did-did all that. When I read the Bible I don’t see nowhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ did that.
SANDLER:: Did what?
STUTTERING MAN:: Forced people to believe in him. Christ wants his people to reason together, not stand there and argue about the color of a person’s skin, not stand there and debate and curse and carry on and fight and hit and punch. That’s not the way . . . that’s not the way Christ would act.

SANDLER:: This is Richard Sandler


Credits, then Epilogue:
HOMELESS MAN:: You do this all the time, you run this recorder you got?
SANDLER:: I like to, as much as I can.
HOMELESS MAN:: But what do you get out of it?
SANDLER:: As much as I can.
HOMELESS MAN:: You don’t sell it to nobody?
SANDLER:: No, I’m gonna take it to another planet, and let them see what it’s like down here, man. And you know what, we got a great God where I’m from, a great God. Forgives everybody, and doesn’t tell them they’re gonna burn in hell.
HOMELESS MAN:: 
SANDLER:: You know like a best friend, you know what I mean?
HOMELESS MAN:: Yeah, yeah . . .
