 Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, muscle for muscle, I consider it the world’s biggest one-man physical project with the help of God. Always open free to the public.

 Without cranes, without money, without a rich daddy, by hand, high school dropout. I work for a living, paid for as I go. No bankers, no loans, no blueprints, no building permit, no inspectors. A place of freedom. A fight for freedom . . .


 The nose of the dragon is a chimney. The mouth will be a burner of propane, also sucking in diesel, so makes orange fire and black smoke. And a little electric starter will light it up, and it will blow fire way out: a fire-breathing dragon.

 You want to walk in and look at it?

 Creeks, fountains, wishing wells. They’ll be double wrought iron gates here, a wrought iron and glass scenic elevator, and a gravity belt escalator down that far buttress. The weight of the people will turn automotive alternators, charging batteries — a tourist- or people electric system. And this tunnel will go back to here . . .
 


 You ever hear of a guy named Buttafuoco?
 Yeah.
 They go on and on about Buttafuoco. What in the hell did he do? Did he ever build anything with his hands? Conan O’Brien — where in the hell did he come from? Arthur Godfrey — was he an actor? You hear about ’em over and over. They’re all newsworthy. And here you guys are — after 24 years, you’re here.

 I’ve heard of Imelda Marcos. I’ve heard of Saddaam Hussein. I’ve heard of all these other people. Have they ever heard of this? They don’t care, do they? They don’t care. I care. If they’re so newsworthy, why ain’t this newsworthy?
