PATIENT 4:: This is Alcatraz Island, man . . .
ISAY:: 
PATIENT 1:: Hello, I’m a mental patient at the Kirby Psychiatric Center. And I’d like to say hello to my man Charles Manson and all the Hell’s Angels international chapter. Signing out. Peace.
PATIENT 2:: My name is Uncle Sam and I am Internal Revenue Service special agent, and I want you to buy US savings bonds. $25 will get you $1,000 increase in seven years to help stop inflation and depression and our boys from going overseas. My name is Uncle Sam . . .
PATIENT 3:: Sailing take me away from where I’m going to. Ooh oh. The wind around . . .
ISAY:: 
PATIENT:: Ha ha ha . . .
ISAY:: 
MOHAMMED:: I think I’m the person you should be talking to, because I’ve been here sixteen years straight.
ISAY:: 

ISAY:: 
MOHAMMED:: You see that man there, on the bed there? Look at him from a distance. What do you see.
ISAY:: Feet?
MOHAMMED:: I mean look at the man. It looks like a dead corpse laying there. And another dead corpse, and another dead corpse, another dead corpse . . .
ISAY:: 
MOHAMMED:: Pushed into a situation that I can’t handle any other way, I will retaliate with either mayhem or murder. And this is with full clear and conscious intent to do such.
ISAY:: 

PATIENT:: (.) I’ll play the Nazi national anthem for you. You know what that is? () Da da da da da.

ISAY:: 
MELVIN:: It was in March the third 1979 when I thought myself to be a federal police officer.
ISAY:: 
MELVIN:: One day I was going out to look for crime, and I didn’t see any crime. I would hear the sirens of the police cars going to the scenes. But I didn’t see any crime. So as I was walking home about three blocks from where I lived, I saw a man walking with a 16 year old boy up the street. So I pulled out my gun. And that’s when I fired and shot him, and he collapsed out in the street.

ISAY:: 
WOYCHUK:: My impression is that people think the insanity plea is a cop out, a way for some a criminal perp to get over and get away with something. Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact what happens is people do a far greater time overall, in maximum security mental hospital, than they would ever do in prison.
VOICE:: Look, look, look: miscarriage, bleach, technical, burden, statute of limitations, lenient, due process of lawful misdemeanor, nine and a half months . . .
ISAY:: 
NICHOLAS:: They shouldn’t throw the prayer of the school away. They don’t have to talk too much. Just say ’Thank you and with your help we proceed.’ That’s all.
ISAY:: 
NICHOLAS:: They had no business to take the prayer out. No business whatsoever.
ISAY:: 
PATIENT:: I had read something once that if you decapitate a person’s head that they go to hell. So that’s where I thought he belonged . . . in hell.
ISAY:: 
WEST:: With all of these patients, every single one, there’s something good there that I can hook into, I can relate to and develop a relationship with, even though sometimes you think ’oh my lord’ when you hear them.
ISAY:: 
ROGER:: When I pulled her eyes out, I wasn’t trying to kill her and I was just trying to stop her from killing herself. She was an alcoholic overweight. And she never understood that by drinking and smoking cigarettes she was killing herself.
ISAY:: Do you consider yourself mentally ill?
ROGER:: No.
ISAY:: 
PETER:: I’m drawing a banana and a fig on a plate all on a table.
ISAY:: Is there a name for this?
PETER:: A working title would be ”Exactly what is it question mark exclamation.”
ISAY:: I like it. Why?
PETER:: If I were going to say why I’d write a book. That’s why I draw pictures.
ISAY:: 
PETER:: I haven’t soaked in a bath. A bath . . . a tub of water . . . a hot tub of water. That’s what I miss. And of course quiet and peace, privacy.
ISAY:: 
PETER:: I imagined that there was an assassin behind the door where we were, who had a gun. And if I didn’t do what was expected for me to do, that assassin would come through the door and kill me. That was the imaginary fear that I acted upon.
ISAY:: 

ISAY:: 
JACK BROWN:: Hi.
ISAY:: What are you doing?
BROWN:: Testing the water. Because sometimes it’s blood, right?
ISAY:: 
JACK:: I talk to ’em all the time. Merv, Bill, they’re God, they’re not the government. They love me, they protect me. They love to play with me.
ISAY:: When was the last time you heard a voice?
JACK:: Just before I started talking to you.
ISAY:: What did the voice tell you?
JACK:: I don’t want to discuss that, you know.
ISAY:: 
JACK:: I seen a man walking down the street with no stomach. This was missing, my midsection? And I also seen a pair of shoes walking down the street. Right. You ever seen any of these things? No? You lucky, you very lucky.
ISAY:: That must be very difficult to live with.
JACK:: It’s enough to frighten you to death. That’s why I want to die now. You know, because I’m tired man, you know.

VOICE:: I am Mestafa Mohammed, I came to North America on my own, as my uncle lives here and he cannot speak my language and does not know that he is my uncle, and loves the devil because he gives him nothing, and he fears the devil because he puts fear in him ever since he was a little boy, and fears him now that he is a grown man . . .
ISAY:: 
WEST:: They are incapable of actually putting themselves in their victims’ or their victims’ families’ shoes. They don’t understand how that person suffered, they can’t experience it. And they’re very wrapped up in their own feelings. And to have inconvenienced them.
ISAY:: 
PATIENT:: I’m quick to say, it’s something that has happened. Regrettably it  happened, but I just can’t constantly wallow in self pity. I can’t do that, I mean life goes on.
ISAY:: 
RUMPEL:: Did you ever see this picture ? When I saw that picture I was wondering how the director got that shot, because that’s how I felt. I just felt like a set of eyes. I felt like the person that is me, the real me, was pushed back and was just an observer. I was more like witness of things that was happening. It was like watching a movie from inside my body. And when I saw that picture I says ’O boy,’ I don’t see how this director got this shot, because that’s how I felt — only like I was a set of eyes. The rest of me was like . . . gone.
ISAY:: 
RUMPEL:: It’s just like sitting in here with you by yourself. You don’t look like you terrified or scared of me. I mean if I was anything like the people in the movies I could jump on you and bite your face, too. Right, but I’m not doing that. And you don’t seem to be at all nervous, you know what I mean.
ISAY:: 

ISAY::  are

ISAY:: 
DWAYNE:: You’re always on the run . . . there’s a reason why we’re here . . . so when the day is done . . .
ISAY:: 
JAN:: Sometimes he’d come over to me and he’d, like when I was sleeping he’d wake me by taking me by the hair and banging my head against the wall. Other times he’d hit me in the head with a frying pan.
ISAY:: 
JAN:: I have dreams about it sometimes. I dream that I see my father all sewn up.
WOYCHUK:: People’s mind do not get that bent unless they’ve had things happen to them.
ISAY:: 
WOYCHUK:: Grisly things . . . unimaginable things. It’s like a nightmare. This is perhaps one of the saddest places in America.

ISAY:: 
PETER:: This is one of those cheap words that gets a lot of points: 4 . . . 8 . . . 16 . . . 23 . . .
SECURITY MAN:: See, I’m a glutton for punishment. He’s always beating me by these unbelievable amounts.
PETER:: Sixty-forty, this game: 60 luck and 40 skill.
ISAY:: 

MOHAMMED::  was the best movie I ever saw. It was touching, it was really touching to see . And Barbra Streisand. She’s an expert actress.
ISAY:: So  is your favorite movie?
MOHAMMED:: Yeah . . . it’s my all time favorite.
ISAY:: Well . . . shalom.
MOHAMMED:: Shalom ().
ISAY:: 

ISAY:: 
PATIENT:: My name is Uncle Sam, and I got a letter for an 18 year old boy or girl . . . draft plan till 36 years. Over here and there say a prayer for Uncle Sam. And don’t stop until Uncle Sam says I am your government of U.S. savings plan. That’s it . . . that’s all I want to say. That’s all . . . like that?
