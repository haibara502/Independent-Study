MARY ANN ZIELONKO::
Kitty was the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. I still remember her face. I can see it in my mind: very Italian looking, very chiseled features, dark hair, like only about five feet tall. And very likeable person, very vibrant, where I’m very quiet, so we were complimentary.
I think we met in a bar downtown, and she says, ”Well, I’d like to see you again.” So I says, ”Well, I don’t have a phone.” I lived in a rooming house. I came home that night from work, and I found the note on the rooming house door. She found where I lived, and called me at the pay phone that night. So we were together for a year after that. One year. One year exactly, to the day.
Being a gay woman in that society was very hard, so we were in the closet a lot. In fact, her family didn’t know. I mean, they know now, but there was denial there. It was very hard then.
I remember I went bowling with a friend of ours and I came home. I was tired that night. It was probably 11:30. I went to bed. And the next thing I remember is the police knocking on the door at 4 o’clock in the morning. So they took me to the emergency room, said, ”You have to identify her.” So I did — standard identifying a person with the white sheet. And I went outside and sat on the bench. They said, We’re going to take you home, and I said, ”I’m going to wait for her.”
Sorry, I’m going to start crying here, but this gets rough…
So I just went home and I started drinking, because I couldn’t deal with this. And I drank for about six months, and I realized this is — what am I doing with my life? So I stopped drinking. I got an apartment, and I went back to school. So, I mean, I know about loss.
I still have a lot of anger toward people because they could have saved her life. I mean, all those steps along the way when he attacked her three times. And then he sexually assaulted her too, when she was dying. I mean, you look out the window and you see this happening and you don’t help. That’s — how do you live with yourself, knowing you didn’t do anything? That’s the biggest lesson to be learned from this: really love each other. We have to on this planet.
