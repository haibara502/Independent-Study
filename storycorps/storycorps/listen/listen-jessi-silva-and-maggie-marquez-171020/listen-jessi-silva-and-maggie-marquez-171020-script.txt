Maggie Marquez (MM) and Jessi Silva (JS):
Maggie Marquez (MM):: I walked into the room and the teacher, she said for us to get a piece of paper and write down, ’I will not speak Spanish in school.’ So I wrote down on a piece of paper, fold it up, and gave it to her.
All the teachers, they had a little cigar box, and put the kids’ little papers in there. And we all marched out to where the flagpole was.
Jessi Silva (JS):: The whole school was there, and they already had this hole dug.
MM:: Yes. And then, uh, they put the box in there and covered it up.
JS:: We had gone to family funerals before, so we understood that there was a funeral going on. But we didn’t know why, and everybody was very quiet when they buried Mr. Spanish.
MM:: They told us to go back to the classes. And we were not supposed to speak Spanish. At all. So I told my friends, ’Nadie me va a parar que yo no hable el español.’ Nobody’s gonna stop me from speaking Spanish. And I didn’t know the teacher was right behind me. And the teacher took me to the principal.
JS:: And what happened there?
MM:: He swung that paddle. And I got three licks.
JS:: Wow.
MM:: It was my first time, and I was hurting, so I ran home. I didn’t go to school for three days. I had big bruises. My dad, he wasn’t happy. ‘Cause they were not supposed to have hit me. But he told me I needed to go back to school and I needed to follow the instructions.
JS:: Our parents always supported the teachers.
MM:: Yes.
JS:: And I remember my dad said, ’If you’re in school, you just be obedient. Don’t stir the waters.’
But I felt…a loss. I felt like something was being ripped away from me. And I was only six, yet I understood that something’s wrong here.
MM:: I wanted to ask questions but I just kept quiet. But now as I have grown older, if I see something that is not right, I’m gonna speak.
JS:: It was part of the past, but you learn things through the past.
