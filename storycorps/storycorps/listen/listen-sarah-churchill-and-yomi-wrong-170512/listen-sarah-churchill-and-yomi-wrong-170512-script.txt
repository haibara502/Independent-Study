 Your skull was fractured, your arms, your ribs, your legs. And then they said that you would probably die during the night. So the best thing would be to leave you at the hospital. But there was no way that I was going to leave you there.
And they had a rocking chair, and I would sit there and hold you. And I remember our hearts touched each other. I used to always say ’we have one heart, you and I.’
 So what was it like caring for me throughout the years?

 The bone snap?
 Yeah. And you were crying, I’m crying.
 I used to keep track of my fractures but then they just got out of control. I would fall or, I remember one time, one of my sisters dropped an orange on me, and that broke something. I mean, you could look at me too hard and I would break. So I have my down periods but I don’t always have to articulate every single thing because you get it. You understand.
biggest desires for wanting to mother is to be able to carry on this legacy of love that you started with me.





 It was my honor.
