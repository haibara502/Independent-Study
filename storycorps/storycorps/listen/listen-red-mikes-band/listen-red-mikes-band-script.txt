 My name? Red Mike. Michael Acampora. Red Mike Festival Band. I’m playing the trumpet since I was 9. I’m still playing. Eighty, eighty, eighty-two, eighty-three years. Yeah, I love to play. That’s it.
 My name is Gus Fiorentino. Fiorentino means ”little flower.” I know Mike 55 years. I remember Mike when he had red hair. It’s the truth.
 My name is Robert Miller. And many of the things that I know how to do on the trumpet is a direct result of Red Mike.
 My name is Pat Brown. Today we are playing a funeral service.

 There’s no name to that song. It’s just we use it as an entrance each time that we go and play before the caskets.
 They call it ”Number One.” Nobody knows the name, except we call it ”Number One,” you know.
 They’ve been doing this thing for seventy years. We used to work six days a week, all year round. One time we were very busy. Every theater house had a band; we used to play with the film. It ain’t happening no more. Forget about it. It’s gone. Once rock’n’ roll came around, it killed us. I seen a lot of guys come and go. Oh God, I think there’s about three guys left. We come here, we do a couple of bad notes, and we go home. That’s it. We’re living to die.p

 Finut! Good! And that completed a Chinese funeral.

 laughs.
 Ah, there comes my girlfriend now.
 Hello
 Hello. Oh, she’s nice. I’d like to dance with her. Ah, I wish I was twenty-two years old again, with what I know now. Hmmm, mar one.
