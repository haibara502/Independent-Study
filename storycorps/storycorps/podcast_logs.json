Eventually they all choose to reveal what they had previously hidden, and also explain how and why they kept their secret for such a long time.When people come for a StoryCorps interview, many times they do not plan on sharing as many personal and intimate details about themselves as they often end up doing. The results can be both shocking and rewarding. When Jackie Miller came to our New York City booth with her son, Scott (pictured at left), she took the opportunity to confess something to him that she had kept private for a very long time.Jackie had adopted Scott in the early 1970s'and he knew that—but what he did not know was that when she was younger, Jackie herself had a child that she had given up for adoption. Jackie told Scott for the first time about the baby she had when she was much younger, and how she knew that when she was ready to have her own family, she would adopt.Some of the hardest places to keep a secret can be in small towns where everyone seemingly knows everyone's business. In 1975, Dick Titus and Zeek Taylor (pictured in the player above) moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, to pursue their relationship and get a little distance from their families. After arriving in town, Dick, an electrician, realized that if he was going to get work, he would have to remain closeted.At StoryCorps, Dick shared stories of the lengths he went to keep his relationship and sexuality a secret from his coworkers, and Zeek, unhappy lying to the people in their lives, discusses how he understood Dick's need for secrecy.Dick and Zeek are now married and have been together for more than forty years.Our next story comes from Andrea Crook, who after graduating high school, moved from her parent's home in Northern California to Los Angeles. While on her own for the first time, she began experiencing the symptoms of mental illness. A few years later she began having paranoid thoughts, delusions, and her behavior became erratic.Almost 20 years later, she came to StoryCorps with her mother, Marilyn Hillerman (pictured above left), to discuss this time in their lives and how a phone call from Andrea's grandfather made her realize that he had been keeping a family secret from her for her entire life—that mental illness runs in their family, and that he had been institutionalized many years earlier.In our final story, Barbara Amaya tells her daughter, Bianca Belteton (pictured at left), about how she ran away from an abusive home and ended up on the streets of Washington D.C., homeless. Only 12 years old at the time, she was picked up by sex traffickers who took advantage of her hunger and loneliness and forced her into prostitution.At StoryCorps, Barbara spoke with Bianca about the years of fear, abuse, and drug addiction, and how she escaped and began healing."]}

In 2006, Priya Morganstern (above left) and Bhavani Jaroff brought their father, Ken Morganstern, to our recording booth in Grand Central Terminal. He was living with Alzheimer's and the sisters wanted to record his memories while they still could.

She lives in California and her mother, Evelyn Wilson, lives in Georgia. Almost a decade ago, Evelyn began to show symptoms of memory loss, and Teresa remembers how their regular telephone conversations began to change.Husband and wife Jo Ann and Bob Chew married later in life, a second marriage for both of them.

In our first story, Terri Van Keuren (top left), Richard Shoup, and Pamela Farrell (top right) discuss the important role their father'Air Force Colonel Harry Shoup—played in starting that tradition.Colonel Shoup was stationed at the Continental Air Defense Command (now known as NORAD) which was tasked with protecting U.S. air space from Soviet attack in 1955 when a misprint in a Colorado Springs newspaper (see above) listed the number for one of the secure military phones on his desk as a direct line for children to call and talk to Santa. Much to his surprise and consternation, a phone that normally remained silent, began to ring regularly.His three children came to StoryCorps to remember their father, an important and serious man with an accomplished military record, who considered giving kids yearly updates on the location of Kris Kringle his proudest professional accomplishment.Next we hear from Carrie Conley whose husband left her to raise their six children on her own. She came to StoryCorps with her youngest child, Jerry Johnson (pictured together at left), who told his mom, “I cannot remember one Christmas that I didn't feel like the luckiest kid in the world.\"What Jerry didn't know at the time was how his mother made their celebrations so special. Carrie would save up all her sick days no matter how ill she was and later cash them out, taking the money to the Salvation Army to purchase toys donated by wealthier families in anticipation of the new ones their children would soon be receiving.And while Carrie made a lot of sacrifices for her children, one concession she would not make, regardless of how much holiday spirit she possessed, was to give credit where it was not due, telling her son, “I never did tell you it was Santa Claus 'cause I said that I can not give no man credit for when I work.\"Finally, we hear from John Cruitt, whose mother passed away two days before Christmas in 1958. At the time, John was a student in Cecile Doyle's third grade class at Emerson School in Kearny, New Jersey.When John returned to school, Cecile was there for him with gentle words and a kind gesture that gave John hope at a very difficult time. More than 50 years later—John, now a teacher himself—reached out to Cecile to thank her for helping change his life.And while they came to StoryCorps to talk about how Cecile helped John, she revealed how his letter, after all these years, helped her through a difficult time as well.Merry Christmas from the StoryCorps podcast."]}

Freeman launched a radical new era in the treatment of mental illness by performing a transorbital (“ice pick\") lobotomy in his Washington, D.C., office. His first patient was a severely depressed housewife named Sallie Ellen Ionesco.After rendering her unconscious through electroshock, Dr. Freeman inserted an ice pick above her eyeball, banged it through her eye socket and into her brain, and then made cuts in her frontal lobes. Freeman believed that mental illness was related to overactive emotions and was convinced he'd found the answer to Ionesco's depression (pictured below in 2004) by cutting her brain and removing those feelings. When he was done, he sent her home in a taxi.In the era before psychiatric drugs'when state institutions were overflowing with mentally ill patients often living in terrible conditions—hospitals, families, and the press were eager to embrace “miracle\" cures like the “ice pick\" lobotomy.For more than two decades, Freeman, equal parts physician and showman, became a barnstorming crusader for the procedure. He traveled in a van to psychiatric hospitals across the country to teach and perform transorbital lobotomies, and before his death in 1972, he performed lobotomies on more than 2,500 patients in 23 states.Howard Dully was one of those patients.Dully's personal journey to find out about his lobotomy took him around the country as he interviewed lobotomy patients, their family members, and people who witnessed the operation. Freeman also photographed each lobotomy he performed, and Howard is the first patient ever to obtain a picture of his own operation (see below photo).“This is my odyssey. Everyone has one thing they have to do before they die, and this is mine.\"In collaboration with Piya Kochhar and Dave Isay, Dully embarked on a remarkable two-year journey to uncover the story behind the lobotomy he received as a 12-year-old boy. for audio extras. for more photos. for a timeline of events. to hear from witnesses."]}

That was our answer to the day after Thanksgiving becoming widely recognized as a national day of shopping'“Black Friday.\" The Great Thanksgiving Listen is a continuation of that project.One major difference between the two initiatives, the National Day of Listening and the Great Thanksgiving Listen, is that we now have the technology to make listening and preserving your stories in the Library of Congress easier than ever. When we debuted the free StoryCorps app in March, it gave all people with access to a smartphone the ability to easily set up an interview, record it, edit it, share it, and then have it archived.By any measure, the Great Thanksgiving Listen was a success. Over the course of a few days, tens of thousands of conversations were recorded, and more than 50,000 of those have been uploaded to the  website and archived at the  at the Library of Congress.The stories that came in were revealing and funny and intense and personal. As we hoped, an incredible number of people sat down with their grandparents or another elder, who with a little prompting, shared their happiest and proudest memories, as well as difficult moments they overcame over the course of their lives. They also shared advice for younger generations that no matter how it was worded, essentially boiled down to a few simple recommendations: Treat others with respect, do a lot of different things with your life, be adventurous, and have a lot of fun because time moves quickly.So before you know it, it will be time for the Great Thanksgiving Listen II.

After returning home from Washington, D.C., one thing that always bothered her mother, Mary Reed (pictured together at left), was that Emma never got a souvenir photo of herself with the congresswoman. So when Giffords' staff planned an event at their neighborhood Safeway on January 8, 2011, Emma and her mother set out to get that photo.They were waiting in line when Jared Lee Loughner began shooting. Mary, who used her body to shield Emma, was shot three times, once in each arm and once in her back. Now, five years later, she is now able to walk, but still has a bullet lodged near her spine. Emma was uninjured.Emma eventually did get a photo with Gabrielle Giffords (pictured above), and their family still shops at that same Safeway. They came to StoryCorps to remember the day.We are just weeks away from the one-year anniversary of what is now known as the Chapel Hill Shooting, a heartbreaking event where three young Muslim students were killed by a neighbor in their apartment.The gunman, who claims he was angry about an ongoing dispute over parking spots, shot and killed Yusor Abu-Salha, her husband, Deah Barakat, and her sister, Razan Abu-Salha.Just months prior to her murder, Yusor Abu-Salha recorded a StoryCorps interview with Mussarut Jabeen (pictured together at left), her third-grade teacher, who knew all three of the victims because they had all attended her school.In their StoryCorps conversation, Yusor and Mussarut share memories of their time in the classroom together.

During their conversation, they shared the story of their first date and a bold question that Danny asked Annie that evening.Over the next few years, Danny and Annie became a part of the StoryCorps family. Danny returned to the booth over and over, interviewing baseball umpires, police officers, and, of course, Annie. And when it came to talking about his wife, Danny proved to be a romantic with a gift for turning a phrase. He embodied one of the central ideas of StoryCorps'that there is poetry and beauty in the words of people you might not otherwise notice while walking down the street.In early 2006, Danny was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The disease spread quickly and he wanted to record one more conversation with Annie, but was too sick to come to the booth. So, we went to their house in Brooklyn, where Danny recorded while lying on his couch with Annie seated next to him. We broadcast that interview in February 2006. That same day, Danny died.When we posted the news online, more than a thousand letters of condolence poured in from listeners. Annie carried copies of the letters with her as she walked behind Danny's casket at his funeral, and buried another set with him that day. Today, she reads one letter each day in place of the love letters she had received daily from Danny.Richie, who suffered from a long illness and whose stories touched so many people, died on February 10, 2016."]}

And Sean and Erin's father had taken out his .38 revolver and hidden it in a dresser drawer.

Raphael lost his leg while Ish was killed. As the driver awaited trial, her sister, Megiddëh reached out to Raphael and his wife, Heidi, to ask them for their forgiveness.The Hameeds accepted her apology and the three of them began to form a friendship to the degree that they offered Megiddëh (pictured together at left with Raphael holding a photo of Ish), a single mother, some of Ish's old clothing for her own child. In May 2015, with Raphael, Heidi, and Megiddëh present in the courtroom, Xyrjah was sentenced to four years in a Colorado community corrections program, an alternative to prison.The three of them came to StoryCorps to discuss the responsibility Megiddëh now feels for the Hameeds and their willingness to forgive.Our next story features a conversation between Marcela Gaviria and Dr. Dempsey Springfield (pictured at left). They first met when Marcela, 12 at the time, was diagnosed with a form of cancer that nearly took her leg, and Dr. Springfield was the surgeon who operated on her. Their patient-doctor relationship has spanned more that three decades now, as Marcela won't let herself be treated by anyone else.They came to StoryCorps to discuss her early memories of the kindness he showed that made her his patient for life, and what it was like for him to do something he had never done before'attend the wedding of one of his patients.Finally, we hear about two lives connected by war. Oklahoma Army National Guard Specialist Justin Cliburn was deployed to Iraq in 2005 helping train local police. He came to StoryCorps with his wife, Deanne (pictured together below), to remember a friendship he struck up with a young Iraqi boy named Ali.Justin remembers Ali (pictured together above) as a very shy kid who came around the soldiers with one of his friends, Ahmed. Even though they did not share a language, they became close friends playing soccer and rock, paper, scissors, together. According to Justin, one day Ali came alone and told him that Ahmed and his mother were together when a suicide bomber struck, killing the woman and injuring Ahmed. Soon after, Ahmed also died and Justin recalls sitting on curb with Ali as they mourned their friend together."]}

I remember you having tears in your eyes when you gave me a hug and told me how you felt about my father.", "PN: He was one of my best friends. I got five fingers.

Eric Lamet was a young boy living in Austria when Nazi Germany annexed that country. The Lamets, who were Jewish, fled to Italy and in the process Eric and his mother got separated from his father. During the war years that followed, they didn't hear anything from him. The war ended, and they still had no word. ", "Eric Lamet (EL): In 1946 an Italian court declared him legally dead.

And I was very excited. I mean, I was sixteen years old at the time. I had not seen my dad in 8 years. I waited at the railroad station for quite a bit of time. I got there a little bit early.", "And my father was a very dapper man. He always dressed in a double-breasted suit. His hair was perfectly combed, always had a kerchief in his jacket. But, um, when the train came I saw these people get off and there was nobody there that even resembled my dad. ", "Eventually, somebody called out my name. He was the only one on the platform at that time. It was a broken man, walking with a limp and a cane, certainly not well-dressed. He was wearing a suit that probably was two, three sizes larger than he was. ", "I was emotionally totally destroyed when I saw my dad. For two hours we spoke on a bench in the railroad station and I remember that he said to me, 'How were you?' and 'How are you?' And the only other question that I remember was he said to me, 'And how do you like this Italian gentleman?' I don't remember anything else that we talked about.", "He eventually decided to immigrate to Palestine. And, um, I did not see my dad for 28 years. One day, when I spoke to his wife, she said to me that he was very sick and he was in the hospital. The next day, I was on a plane. My father did not know that I was coming because I didn't tell anybody I was going. But as I entered the door of the hospital room – he was the only one there.

Whether helping establish a romance, building confidence in a teen, or forcing two men to break down its racial barriers, the film industry's reach extends far beyond Hollywood.In the 1970s, Sigmund Stahl's coworker decided he was going to fix him up on a few blind dates. Initially Sigmund wasn't interested, but he finally relented and went out for drinks with one of the women. Their evening continued on to a movie theater where the woman's choice of film impressed Sigmund with its chutzpah.Sigmund came to StoryCorps with his granddaughter, Elizabeth (pictured together at left), to tell her about his first date with the woman who would become his wife (and her grandmother), and about the film that made him want to see her again.Ricardo Pitts-Wiley attended high school in the late 1960s. In his sophomore year he was bussed to a school with very few other African American students. The next year, when he was cast in the school play, , his classmates were far from supportive. But when he came onstage opening night he was able to summon the charismatic powers of film star Brock Peters (pictured above)'a hero of his with big muscles and an even bigger voice.He came to StoryCorps with his son, Jonathan (pictured together at left), to remember the tough times he had in high school.For the second year in a row, only white actors were nominated in the top Oscar acting categories. Our final story is a conversation between Willie Harris and Alex Brown (pictured together at left). In the 1960s, they were trying to break into the film industry as stuntmen. Realizing that they were not being offered a shot because of their skin color—not even being allowed to train on studio run stages and in certain gyms—they took matters into their own hands.Willie and Alex came to StoryCorps to remember how they broke into Hollywood.

When she was younger, Myra did not realize that there was anything different about her mother, but over time, she became aware that Bonnie was not like her friend's moms. In their conversation, they discuss the complicated emotions'both happy and scared—that Bonnie felt after discovering she was pregnant.In 1968, Mary Moran Murphy and Susan Mello Souza (pictured together at left) were teenagers, they did not know each other when they became pregnant at about the same time. Their families wanted to keep their pregnancies a secret, so they were sent off to Saint Mary's Home for Unwed Mothers in Dorchester, Massachusetts, where they remained until they gave birth and their babies were placed up for adoption.Mary and Susan were roommates at the home where they were given fictitious names and told not to share their real identitles. They ignored this, spending their time together helping each other through a very difficult experience by talking and just being normal teenage girls. They came to StoryCorps to remember their shared experiences in the home and how they felt giving up their daughters (who they have both reunited with since).Our next story comes from New York City. Rita Fischer, 91, and her son, Jay (pictured together at left), discuss his coming out to his parents in the 1980s. Rita recalls that when Jay called with the news she was shocked. Jay, for his part, was also shocked—that Rita had no idea he was gay since his partner was at their apartment all the time. Now, Rita often brags (as any mother should) about her wonderful son, and as of December 2015, she has raised over $1,000,000 for AIDS Walk New York.Our last story was recorded with the StoryCorps app and is introduced by StoryCorps founder Dave Isay. Elizabeth Bell's mother, Sara (pictured together at left), suffers from dementia and at the time Elizabeth conducted this interview, Sara was slowing losing her ability to speak. Elizabeth wanted to make this recording (and subsequently others) to capture her mother's voice so that she would always have it with her. Since Elizabeth made the recordings, her mother's condition has deteriorated and she now rarely speaks."]}

I'm Michael Garofalo. The stories in this episode are all about survivors. And we'll start with survivors of the Bubonic Plague.", "Yes, the plague, the black death that killed about a third of Europe's population during the Middle Ages. But this story doesn't take place in a medieval village. It takes place in 2002 in New York City.", "See, the plague, even though it feels like something from the history books, is very much alive, though it is rare. In the U.S., there are just a handful of cases reported each year. Now, it's not transmitted by rats like many people think, but by the fleas that live on rats and other rodents. And since wherever there are people living, there are usually rodents nearby, the infection can jump species fairly easily. All it takes is a flea bite.", "Lucinda Marker and her husband John Tull were bitten by fleas near their home in New Mexico, just before they left for a vacation in New York. And that's where our story begins.", "[MUSIC OUT]", "Lucinda Marker (LM): We had been feeling sick for a few days in a hotel room–thought we had the flu–and decided, maybe we didn't. And of course, it was a good thing we got to the hospital because it was the first case of plague in New York City in over a hundred years.", "John Tull (JT): And for a married couple to both get the plague, at the same time, was an inconceivable thought.", "LM: They thought maybe we were terrorists or victims of bioterrorism. A few hours later that day, you were in a coma. So, what do you remember after you woke up?", "JT:What really struck me was, where have I been? I thought,  And you told me that I'd been in a coma for almost 90 days.", "LM: What do you think kept you alive?", "JT: I think there's one of three reasons. The first reason is because I'm a tough son of a bitch. The second reason is because God just didn't want me at that particular time. The third reason is, we knew my oldest son and his wife were pregnant with the first grandchild. And by God, I was going to stay alive to see that little grandbaby. If I had just folded into a wet dishrag on the bed, I think it would have let a lot of people down.", "LM: So, why do you think we got it?", "JT: Well, in my opinion, it's just called bad luck.", "LM: I agree.", "JT:As an old West Texan would say, we drew the black bean. But, you know, I was in the hospital for a total of 224 days. If it hadn't been for you, from the very beginning, I would have died. It almost makes me cry.", "LM:You know what I think? If you can live through something like the plague, you can probably live through just about anything.", "JT: That's absolutely true. And we did it.", "LM: Together. That's how we'll keep doing everything else.", "JT: That how we'll keep doing it until the day one of us really leaves.", "[MUSIC -“I'll Become Everything\" by Nick Jaina ]", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG: Bubonic plague survivors John Tull and his wife, Lucinda Marker, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. They recorded that conversation ten years to the day that John woke up from his coma. John died in 2014, not from a medieval plague, but a modern one, ' cancer. He was 65.", "So, in this episode, we're not talking about television game show, last-man-standing type of survival. The people we're hearing from have either survived something so rare, like Lucinda and John, or something so large that unless you've lived through it, it's hard, maybe even impossible, to comprehend. Sometimes, these people end up being the keepers of certain stories and memories that are so potent that they don't share them with anyone. And these memories, they're a burden that they didn't ask for, but one that they cannot say no to.", "Debbie Fisher's dad, Oscar, was in that situation. In January of 1945, he was one of the prisoners liberated from the most infamous Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz. Here's Debbie.", "Debbie Fisher (DF):My father was a Holocaust survivor. He had survived the same camp as Elie Wiesel. They were both the same age. And when my dad was alive, through school, I was reading Night. I was 14 years old when I was reading it. But I had no idea that the Auschwitz that Wiesel was writing about, where he lived for a year, was the same one that my father lived in. Because my father's Auschwitz was a kinder, gentler Auschwitz. It was sort of like Robin Hood and his merry men meet the Nazis in my father's Auschwitz. There was never a moment where people were dying in front of him. The worst happened the first night. They killed his siblings and they killed his parents and from that moment on the boys took over and that was the story that we were given.", "But when he was very, very sick in the hospital and I knew that I was losing him, I realized that there was no going back and that if I didn't make my move I could not return to the moment of having access to his memories. And this time he was really tired and he wasn't feeling well. And I said, I need to ask you about your time there, in Auschwitz. I need to ask you some things, Dad. It's important. And I remember he looked at me, and he had real anger in his face and in his eyes. And he said, You know, Debbie, from the time that you were a young girl, you always asked your questions. And I always told you: We got food, we got bread, we divided it up, we didn't suffer. It was fine. And you keep bothering me and asking me the question. And I keep telling you, as if I'm in a room, go away, stop knocking on the door, I do not want to let you in this room. And yet you keep coming back saying let me in. And he said, So I'll ask you one more time to go away, and if you knock again, I'll let you in. But if I let you in this room, you will never, ever get out. So, do you want to knock again and come in? And I said, Yes, I do, Dad. And he was crying, and I remember he had covers on his body because he was really skinny and very, very weak. And he kicked all the covers off, as if he was kicking down a door. And he said, Fine. Come in then. Come into a room that you can never leave. Come in. And I said can I ask you my questions? and he said, You're in the room. You can ask anything. And I asked him everything that I ever wanted to ask. I asked him to tell me the real story. And he did.", "It was painful, and scary, and sickening. I felt a part of me had died. And he's right. Once you're in that room you can't get out. It's always with you.", "[MUSIC – Peter Rudenko “5:00 AM\"]", "MG:That's Debbie Fisher remembering her father, Oscar, an Auschwitz survivor.", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG:Debbie had the prisoner number of another survivor, a woman named Magda Blau, tattooed on her forearm, after learning her story at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. And when this interview was first broadcast, for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, we included a picture of that tattoo on the web. Because of that photo, Magda Blau's daughter, who lives in Australia, found Debbie, and they met for the first time in New York in 2006.", "Being a survivor can mean being alone. It can put you in a special category all by yourself. Like Lance Corporal Travis Williams, an Iraq war veteran. He is the only Marine, post 9/11, to lose every other member of his 12-man squad. It happened in August 2005. Williams and his 11 teammates had been sent out on a rescue mission in Barwana.", "Travis Williams (TW):That morning, we loaded into the vehicle. And I get tapped on the shoulder and I got told that I need to bounce up to the next vehicle. I said, “Catch you guys on the flipside.\" And that was the last thing I ever said to them. Next thing I know, I just hear the loudest explosion. And I see, that's my squad's vehicle that got hit. The bomb flipped it upside down, it ripped it completely in half, and everything inside of it was just parts. And uh, we got to wait for the chopper to come recover them. So the guys from the rest of our platoon had to go out there with blankets and cover up these body parts, so dogs don't come and grab my friend's arm and have a meal. When I got back into our room for the first time, it was just a mess, you know. We had to spend the next couple of days just packing all this shit up, and mailing it home to their families. Mailing their letters that they hadn't mailed, and cleaning up the dishes that they hadn't cleaned up and… There's dirty laundry… It was all I had left of my friends. And uh, when I got home, I knew that I would meet these guys' parents, their girlfriends and their brothers and sisters and…It's hard because I feel guilty for being the one guy left. But I also feel a responsibility. I better make sure that everybody knows who these guys were, what these guys did. And you know, I am most proud of not blowing my head off by now. It's just a whole lot easier if you're dead. But that shouldn't be your tribute to your dead friends. When they're looking down on you, they don't want you to be living in the moment that killed them. You made it. You got home. You should honor their memory by living the life that they didn't get to live.", "Squad Leader Justin Hoffman, Team Leader David Kreuter, Team Leader Brett Wightman, Team Leader Aaron Reed, Lance Corporal Eric Bernholtz, Lance Corporal Michael Cifuentes, Lance Corporal Edward August Shroeder, Lance Corporal Timothy Bell Lance, Lance Corporal Grant Fraser, Lance Corporal Nicholas Bloem, Lance Corporal Christopher Dyer.", "[MUSIC – Christopher Bowen “I Want to See You Fly\"]", "MUSIC OUT]", "[MUSIC – Lee Rosevere “In A Moment\"]", "MG: That's it for this episode of the StoryCorps podcast.

In StoryCorps interviews, we often hear how parents or grandparents inspire our passions in ways that we could never have expected.

Every Saturday morning he picked me up at 7 am and we would go to his gardening route. We would spend our days mowing, pulling weeds and blowing leaves. He started teaching me specialized things, how to prune roses and plant them and create new roses.

And I've never been around anybody that's seen me at a more vulnerable state. The greater picture is that I need to be here for my daughter. You know, she's 10 now.

My father didn't have someone to ease him off the edge six months ago, and he missed my 27th birthday.

", "[MUSIC OUT] ", "Laura Greenberg (LG): My father would be in his boxer shorts in front of the stereo with a baton.  He loved classical music, and he would play it really loud and he would conduct the orchestra. ", "The problem growing up in my home was that I didn't know what was normal.  We're yelling and we're pinching and we're hugging and we're cursing and… we peed with the door open.  I mean, I didn't know this was not normal behavior.  I didn't know people had secrets, you didn't tell your mother everything.", "Rebecca Greenberg (RG): When did you learn?", "LG: Well, it's still hard. ", "RG: [Laughs] Who were your old boyfriends, how many did you have before dad?", "LG: I didn't have a lot of boyfriends.  I had the neighbor boy.  My mother loved him.  But he wore his pants really high.  And he had an underbite ' ew, god.  But no one wanted to have sex with me, really, until I met your father.  He was cute, but very very quiet and I scared the crap out of him.  The first time he kissed me he had a nosebleed all over his face he was so nervous.  It was terrible, it was, I don't know.  Still married thirty five years later.  Unbelievable.  ", "RG: [Laughs]", "RG: Has your life been different than what you imagined? ", "LG: Yeah, a little bit.  I married a Jewish lawyer and he makes no money. So, I thought I'd found success.  And, you know, he's an indigent defense criminal lawyer and um he saves lives.

I would get this psychotic hysterical laughter. So they already knew I was nuts. And I said, \"This is so refreshing.\" They don't ask about when I'm getting my period, or how much money I make, or did I make a doody today. You know, my family was so intrusive.

I mean, all my friends, they would rather hang out at my house with my parents than hang out with me.", "LG: But Rebecca was the one who said she really wanted to do a StoryCorps interview. You know, when I listen on my way to work, I'm crying and my mascara's running. And they're very tender, you know, heartfelt stories.

And if you've watched any of the games, you definitely saw something originated by a man named Kenny Sailors. He's regarded as the very first person to ever shoot a jump shot in the game of basketball. And a few years ago, when the mobile booth stopped in Laramie, Wyoming, Kenny, who was 87 at the time, came into the booth with a friend and explained how his famous shot got its start. ", "Kenny Sailors (KS): I started out learning about the game of basketball on that old farm down in Hillsdale with my brother who was incidentally an outstanding ball player, probably the most outstanding one Hillsdale had had up until that time. He wanted me to play too, and of course I was just a punk kid and so he put a basket, a hoop, it didn't have any net on it. And ah, he worked out against me sometimes, even though he was five years older and of course, the good lord must have put it in my mind, if I'm going to get up over this big bum so I can shoot, I'm going to have to jump. It probably wasn't very pretty, but I got the shot off. And it went in. And ah, Bud says, \"boy you better develop that, that's going to be a good shot\". So I started working on it.", "The NBA started up in 1946, and I signed up with Cleveland, and in that day, nobody jumps you see, everybody had to keep both feet on the floor or the coach would take you out of the ball game. And I was out there scrimmaging or playing around before the season started and of course, my first coach was old 'Dutch\" Dehnert', an old time ball player. And old Dutch is on the side, I saw him sitting over there watching us. And when we got all done, he said, 'Sailors, where'd you get that leaping one hander?', and I said, 'well Dutch, I don't know, I've been shooting that for a long time', and he said, 'you'll never go in this league with that shot'. Well I thought my career was over with right now. That's kind of how it all came about.", "I'll get several letters a week as a rule and they'll ask me questions like, 'Did you really start the jump shot?', what am I going to say? I usually want to write back, I say, 'Well Ray Myer from DePaul…', who coached there for many, many years, he said it the best I think, he said, 'Sailors might not have been the first player to jump in the air and shoot the ball, but he developed the shot that is being used today', that's way he put it and I like that.", "[MUSIC “Graduation\" by Podington Bear] ", "MG: That's Kenny Sailors with his friend, Anne Brande, in Laramie, Wyoming.

And if you want to learn more about him, check out the New York Times obituary that was published this past January. The jump shot is just the tip of the iceberg for Mr Sailors.

Thirty stations in New York alone aired Jewish programming: advice shows, variety shows, man-on-the-street-interviews, news programs, music, and game shows in both Yiddish and English. The programs in this collection give us one of the most intimate snapshots of American Jewish life in the 1930s and '40s'the collision of Yiddish and American cultures, the dawning reality of the genocide occurring across the ocean, and the day-to-day lives of immigrants struggling to make it in a new land. started when ethnomusicologist Henry Sapoznik (who is credited with sparking the Klezmer music revival in the United States) tripped over a pile of 16″ aluminum disks in a musty storage room in New York City. He paid $30 for the collection of 100 discs. The seller was thrilled.Over the years, Sapoznik has amassed the largest (and only) collection of Yiddish radio in the world—more than 500 hours of rich, wonderful, irreplaceable material from this critical and tumultuous era in American Jewish history.For the next two episodes of the StoryCorps podcast, we'll revisit some of the public radio documentaries produced from this collection by Sapoznik, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay, and Yair Reiner as they were broadcast on NPR's  in 2002.In Part 2, you'll hear about Charlie Levine's Flying Machine, a one-man radio station, and a Yiddish crooner.What?

I can remember him getting injured and he'd just take axle grease and put it in the cut and keep working. But he wasn't allowed to race at certain speedways. He had death threats not to come to Atlanta. And Daddy said, 'Look. If I leave in a pine box, that's what I gotta do. But I'm gonna race.' I can remember him racing in Jacksonville and he beat them all. But they wouldn't drop the checkered flag. And then when they did drop the checkered flag, they had my father in 3rd place. One of the main reasons that they gave was there was a white beauty queen and they always kissed the driver.", "WS: Did he ever consider not racing anymore?", "FS:Never. That was one of my daddy's sayings, 'When it's too tough for everybody else, it's just right for me.' Like I can remember one time when we were racing the Atlanta 500 and, um, he was sick. He needed an operation. And I said, 'Daddy, we don't have to race today.' He whispered to me and said, 'Lift my legs up and put me in the car.' So, I took my arms and put behind his legs and I kind of acted like I was hugging him and helped him into the car. He drove 500 miles that day.", "WS:How did his racing career officially end?", "FS:Well, finances. You know, he couldn't get the support. Where other drivers that we were competing against had major sponsorships, providing them engineers, as many cars as they needed, he did everything that he did out of his own pocket. He always felt like someday he's gonna get his big break. But, uh, for twenty years nobody mentioned Wendell Scott. At one point it was like he never existed. But he didn't let it drive him crazy.

But I'll say that it relates to a phenomenon of my life that once I actually learn there is such a thing as black history, which occurred in the biggest way for me as a college freshman. You know? That's where I took a course in black literature and that started kind of a lifelong passion around that stuff. And what never fails to amaze me is the regularity with which i learn about significant accomplishments and other things to be proud of that I never knew about.

In this episode of the podcast, we hear from people who have baseball in their blood.We begin with the intense competition that takes places in every ballpark, right in front of you, but not on the field. In stands across the country, vendors roam the stadiums with cases of hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts, soda, and beer, competing with each other to be the top salesperson. And one of the all-time greats is Clarence Haskett.Known to Baltimore Orioles fans as “Fancy Clancy,\" he has worked the crowds for 43 years, having started at an age when he was too young to legally sell alcohol. But once he was old enough, Clancy began selling beer, the vendor's most prized offering, and during his illustrious career, he has sold more than a million cups to baseball fans in Baltimore — a Hall of Fame worthy-number.Clancy sat down with Jerry Collier, a former fellow beer vendor to talk about his work.Our second story deals with another competition that takes place far from the diamond. Anthony D'Andrea grew up in the shadows of the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. While he didn't have the money to attend games, he was often part of the crowd of kids outside the stadium looking for autographs from players as they arrived before the game.Anthony came to StoryCorps with his daughters, Monica McInerney and Mary D'Andrea, to share the strategy he used during the 1943 season to get the entire Yankee team to sign his baseball.While the start of the season offers hope for so many, the end of a season — for the fans of all but one team — is often filled with disappointment and despair.In the 1950s, fans of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who during that decade lost in three World Series to the hated Yankees, knew disappointment all too well. Our final two stories come from Harvey Sherman, a life-long Dodgers fan. Harvey remembers listening with his school friends on a transistor radio as Bobby Thompson hit one of the most famous home runs in baseball history — the shot heard  ‘round the world that clinched the 1951 pennant for the New York Giants and devastated Dodgers fans. And later, he recalls being part of a small number of fans that turned up on September 24, 1957, at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, to witness the team's final game before they moved to Los Angeles. In that story, you'll hear the official Dodgers theme song played by the Ebbets Field organist, Gladys Goodding."]}

If I'd known I would have tried a little bit harder to have that conversation with you, and maybe start it myself.", "GL: Um, do you worry about me?", "CL: I worry about how other people might treat you.

They record mostly for themselves, or for the archive, or for posterity, and we give them the option to NOT release the interview for broadcast, they can say no. When we wanted to run Gabe's story one of our producers, Von Diaz, had a long conversation with Chris about what it would mean for them. Here's how and why they decided to go ahead with it.", "CL:We told him “you know, there are going to be people who have some not nice things to say, some pretty hurtful things in some cases, I'm sure. And you don't have to do anything you don't want to. We can save this for ourselves, we have it recorded to listen to any time we want,\" and he considered it. We answers a lot of his questions and in the end he's the one who said, “There might be other kids out there who feel like I feel and they might not have the support that I have. And, if they feel alone I want them to hear my story and know that there are other people out there just like them.\"", "MG:That's from a follow-up interview we did with Gabe and his parents, Chris and Julio, just last week. With the recent announcement that the federal government was rescinding Obama era guidelines protecting transgender kids at school, we wanted to see how they were doing and if anything had changed.", "Gabe, who's nine years old now, has been attending the same school since kindergarten. In the fall of 2015, when he started third grade, Gabe began having his classmates refer to him by \"he\" and “him\" for the first time. And he says, for the most part, so far so good.", "GL:Some people slip up and call me “Gabby\" by accident. I'm okay if it's like by accident, but if they did it on purpose I am not cool with that.", "MG:That hasn't happened to Gabe at school, yet. In fact, Gabe's school already has protections written into the district codes that protect the rights of transgender kids so he hasn't been directly affected by the government's actions.", "But other families they know have, and the Lopez family and these other families have been  been supporting each other. Even going to school board meetings in each other's districts.", "It's worth emphasizing what a big deal this kind of support is for Gabe's parents. In his interview, Gabe says going to a camp for transgender kids was a turning point for him. What you don't hear is that the whole family went, that's how it works, everyone is invited. And meeting other families there, that was a watershed moment for Chris and Julio also.", "Julio Lopez (JL):Connecting with those parents was the biggest thing. Showing that I'm not alone, there's other people out there that are going through the same things that we are, because at that time I was kind of having a hard time with the idea of Gabe transitioning. And it's not because I was against it, it was just that I was scared for him. We've heard stories where there's been suicides and murders with kids like Gabe. That's what scared me.", "CL:It's just so overwhelming in the beginning. Sometimes I'm embarrassed by some of the questions that I have and I know that I can go to the other parents. There's no judgement, it's complete support and I don't know how we would do it without them. One thing I'll never forget that first year was Cooper's mom spoke up and said, “You know, you just have to meet your child where they are.\" And so, I need to just pay attention to what's going on with Gabe and stay in constant communication with him. And wherever he is at any given point, that's where I need to be. And, that's all I've ever tried to do on this entire journey. Just meet them where they are.", "[MUSIC Blue Dot Sessions “Surly Bonds\"]", "MG:Chris and Julio don't expect everyone to agree with or understand what they're doing, and they've had their fair share of questions, comments, and hate thrown their way. But there have been surprises along the way as well.", "CL:I was really nervous about telling my grandmother because she's always been religious and she just comes from an older generation. And, I didn't know if there was a word that translated for transgender from English to Spanish. I had to ask around, like, “Do I describe it to her?\" “How do I describe it to her?\" And ultimately I had some discussions with my mom and my mom decided maybe it's best if I try to explain it to her. And, I was so nervous waiting to hear back from my mom about how that conversation went. My mom called me and said, “She had no problems with it and she actually told me about an older family member who is no longer here, has past away, but who she actually suspects may have been transgender and there just wasn't a word for it back then and that's just not something you spoke of.\" And I thought that was the most amazing response that she could have given. That she could just make that connection and instantly understand in this other way that I could never have predicted.", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG:Still, even with a strong community of friends and family the Lopez's have fear for what the future will hold for Gabe.  So much so that Chris and Julio have considered enrolling him in self defence classes.", "All through our conversation, Chris and Julio just kept talking about how lucky they feel. They've heard so many stories from adults who are transgender about how isolated, ashamed, afraid, and unsafe they felt growing up and the Lopez's really want to spare Gabe as much of that as possible.", "And this isn't lost on Gabe either, who's taken to leaving notes on his mother's bedside table. We asked him what they say.", "GL:Thank you for supporting me and stuff.  ‘Cause a lot of people don't have that kind of support. I don't do it that often anymore, but maybe I'll do it today.", "[MUSIC Blue Dot Sessions “Vittoro\"]", "MG:One thing Gabe doesn't mention that I think it incredibly cute is he signs these notes to his parents in his full name, Gabe Lopez.", "Julio and Chris say they'll just continue to follow their son's lead. Meet him where he is. And if their experience over the past couple of years is any proof, they'll continue to be impressed.", "CL:He is so much braver than I was at his age. I mean, I'm not sure if being a fourth grader I could go to school and handle the anxiety that comes along with, “what are people thinking about me?\"", "JL:Gabe's still the same Gabe. He's a very, very strong kid. We always knew that from the very beginning. But, to take on this knowing exactly what's gonna be for him in the future it's…it's…I don't know. I give him props.", "CL:It's funny their father/son relationship, I look at it as being stronger than their father/daughter relationship ever was because of how strong that bond has gotten through this whole process, and how much they rely on one another.

He had an explosive temper and according to Julie spent most weekends getting drunk with his skinhead friends and looking for people to fight. When he didn't find anyone to take his anger out on, he would focus it on her.On November 12, 1988, it all came to a head when Mieske and two of his friends came across three Ethiopian men, including a 27-year-old student named Mulugeta Seraw. After exchanging words, Mieske struck Mulugeta multiple times with a baseball bat and while he lay on the ground, Mieske struck him again savagely killing him.Months later, Mieske pleaded guilty to murder. He died in prison in 2011.Julie was there that evening and in her 2012 StoryCorps interview with her friend, Randy Blazak (pictured together above), she talks about being with Mieske the night of the killing and wrestling with her own guilt ever since. She also discussed her attempts to raise her children with love in their lives and teach them to be more caring and protective of those around them.The public reaction to the broadcast was intense. While some praised Julie for sharing her secret and owning her past, others felt that her affiliation with the hate group and her presence at the murder were unforgivable.In this week's podcast, producers Michael Garofalo and Jasmyn Belcher Morris check in with Julie to talk about her life since the broadcast and how others, after hearing her story, began reaching out'through the anonymity offered by of social media—to confess their own shameful secrets."]}

I'm Michael Garofalo.", "In this episode, we're listening to stories about work. Now, when you think about what it means to go to work, you might think about your commute, paying your bills, your next vacation. There are plenty of times when we look at our jobs this way ' as a means to an end. But sometimes, the idea of work becomes much more than that. Sometimes, we get the feeling there's something that we are called to do with our lives. ", "That's the subject of the newest StoryCorps book —  It's full of stories from people who all share something in common. For them, their work is about much, much more than just making a living. ", "Take Angelo Bruno, for instance. Angelo spent over thirty years as a sanitation worker in New York City. He worked with a partner, Eddie Nieves, and they'd clear over fourteen tons of garbage a day from the city's streets. ", "The long-time partners sat down for a StoryCorps conversation shortly after Angelo retired, and they looked back on their days together on the route.", " Everybody would just come out just to talk to you.", "People would say,  ‘Oh, good morning Angelo. Good morning Eddie. You want a cup of coffee? You want lunch?'", " And the nuns kissing us, too. We had nuns on our route. You know, I never had that before.", " (Laughs) The younger guys would ask me,  ‘How did you get that?' It's just a little good morning, have a nice weekend. Hey, you look great today. I could do 14 tons of garbage, I can't lift a baby carriage off a step and carry it down? Or hold someone's baby when they went to get their car?", " The garbage ain't going nowhere. You know? The garbage will be there a half hour from now, an hour… so when you get it, you get it.", " He made a statement one day that he does all the work and I do all the talking.", " It came out wrong.", " Look how he's getting out of this,  ‘It just came out wrong.' (laughs)", " I deserve it.", " When I first came on the job, there was one old timer… I remember Gordy Flow his name was. One day, he stopped the truck. He tells me,  ‘Angelo, you look down this block first. See all the sidewalks are all crowded up with garbage?' So I think nothing of it. My father always told me to respect my elders. I get to the end of the block, and he stops me again.  ‘Get out of the truck, look back. Nice and clean right? People could walk on the sidewalk. Guys can make deliveries. Be proud of yourself.'", "The day that people learned that you were going to retire, we went maybe a block or two blocks and six people came up to him saying,'You're crazy. What am I going to do when you leave?'", " I'm a little bit of a marshmallow anyway, but I never thought my last day would be so emotional for me.", " He's crying. They're crying. I'm crying watching them cry. And I've been very lucky because he's been the best partner I ever had. We used to try and take the same vacation and try to take the same day off. And I miss my partner.", " I feel the same way, Eddie. I'll be honest with you — I miss it terribly, I'm like the little kid looking out the window now when I hear the truck. I think I could have done another 31 years.", "[MUSIC] ", " That's New York City Sanitation Workers Angelo Bruno and Eddie Nieves. They're in the new StoryCorps book. And joining me now is someone who was a member of the editorial team and had a huge hand in creating this book, Cailey Cron. Hi, Cailey. ", "Hi, Michael. ", "So, I want to ask you about the book, but first can you tell us a little bit about what's going on with Eddie and Angelo today?  ‘Cause this was recorded several years ago. ", "Yes. So, the big news is that Eddie retired just two months ago. And he too had been on the job for over 30 years as Angelo had when he retired. And I talked to him just this past week. He misses the route a lot and really misses all those people that he and Angelo talk about. And in fact, he misses his route so much that he's planning on biking it this spring, just so that he can say hi to everyone.", "[MUSIC] ", " So, this is a book about people's work, and there's, of course, a very famous book called of oral histories, by a giant in the field and one of the godfathers of StoryCorps, Studs Terkel. When you guys set out to make this book, were you hoping to follow in his footsteps or were you trying to do something else? ", "Well, this book was definitely inspired by Studs in part. But  is different from his work in a lot of ways. It's not just about work, it's not just about people talking about their 9 to 5, and whether they hate it or whether they love it.  is really about meaningful work. And that doesn't mean that it's just about dream job success stories. The stories in are really varied, and they show that people take a lot of different paths to find meaningful work. And those aren't always easy paths either. And they're not always the paths that people expect. There are stories in this book of folks who thought they were on their way to a dream job that turned out not to be a dream job. And on the way, they discovered something else that they loved even more. ", "So let's listen to another story. It's Barbara Moore. She was a bricklayer in Baltimore for more than 40 years. She worked on a lot of that city's landmarks, including Camden Yards where the Orioles play. ", "She started lugging bricks at 21 years old and just 115 pounds. And she was the only woman doing the job in the entire city at that time. Here, she tells her daughter, Olivia Fite, that being a bricklayer wasn't always the plan. ", " Right out of high school I worked in a office, but a couple hours behind a desk and I was falling asleep. So I became a bricklayer.", " Well I specifically remember getting bullied at school and telling boys that were bullying me, \"You better watch out, my mom's a bricklayer and she'll come beat you up if you mess with me.\" (Laughter)", "Well it was kind of rough at first  ‘cause, you know, a lot of the older guys, didn't think I should be there and I was taking a job from a man. But I believed that I could do that job. And I was working with this guy Tony Anello, who was a WWII vet, and he had a plate in his head. And he was, you know, really old school guy, but he was willing to work with me when a lot of other people did not want me as their partner. And, uh, when he passed away his daughter called me and said that he wanted to leave me his tools. So that, I think that's probably – if you're getting tools from the bricklayers that have gone before you that would be a sign of respect.", " I can't even really remember a time that you came home and you said, \"Ugh, I'm gonna quit,\" or, \"This is too hard.\" And I, at a very young age, learned how to massage your calloused hands, and then a little later on in life sometimes I would paint your fingernails …", " Not that a manicure lasted very long. (Laughter)", " I noticed that throughout my life people always come up to me on the street and say, “Are you Barbara Moore's daughter?\" There's a lot of people in this town that have a great respect for you, and you've earned that.", " Well you're very kind. (Laughter)", " Well how would you like to be remembered?", "The only thing that's important to me, my dear, is that you remember me.", " But you've had your hands in so many things that will last for so much longer than either one of us.", " I know, I don't care about that. Whatever I did I was always something that I wanted to do for you.", "[MUSIC – Benji Inniger and Beret Ouren “Minor Detail\"] ", "That's Barbara Moore with her daughter, Olivia Fite, in Baltimore.", "At one point in this interview, Barbara tells Olivia that when she was pregnant with her, she continued to lay brick up until her eighth month. And at that point, she was experiencing pretty bad morning sickness, but she wasn't always able to just run down the scaffolding and find a bathroom. The best alternative was the cinderblocks. So, let's just say that there are surprising and perhaps unintended things inside some of a few Baltimore buildings.", "That's pretty gross, but I love it. So, this is the fifth StoryCorps book. And one thing that I'm curious about, because, of course, I do audio, is how do you make one of these things?", " So, the editorial process for started over two years ago. And once we decided on a broad theme—work—we turned to our archive. So, we were looking through 65,000 stories. And we were able to cull that down to a couple thousand and then a couple hundred and then down to about 150 or so interviews that we transcribed, the full 40-minutes. And then, our wonderful editorial team edited them in print, much like you, as a producer, would edit a story in audio. ", "One thing that's different though in print is that we have to decide how to translate someone's voice onto the page. How do we show regional dialects? How do we capture people's patterns of speech? It's not just about creating a clean, precise story. It's about capturing the feel and the personality and putting that onto the page.", "Each of the final 53 stories, once they're all together in a book, they're almost in conversation with each other. There are these common themes that emerge across generations, careers. And it's a beautiful, beautiful thing to see all these stories together adding up to something more than the sum of their parts. ", " And one thing about the book that listeners should know is that there's a lot of stuff in there that has never been heard by anyone before. It's not been on the radio, it was recorded, put in the archive and this is the first time that you're able to read it, hear it or learn about this person's story. ", "Yes, almost half of the stories in are entirely new. And even stories that have been broadcast before are different in print. We have a little bit more space to add more backstory and more information, so all of them are new in some way. ", " Now, there's a section of the book that's called, “Healers,\" and I was wondering if you could explain a little bit what that idea is. ", " Sure, in “Healers,\" we have stories from doctors, EMTs, people who are healing the physically sick. And then we also have stories from people who are healing broken systems or communities. Like, a public defender or a teacher. ", " And one of those teachers is actually kind of healing himself through his work also. His name is Ayodeji Ogunniyi. He came to the US from Nigeria with his family in 1990, when he was just a young child. They settled in Chicago, where his mother worked as a nurse and his father drove a cab. And Ayodeji remembers his dad as the kind of person who made sure his son's homework was done, but snuck him toys and treats when his mother wasn't looking.", "Ayodeji's parents envisioned a really bright future for him. They pushed him to work hard in school and to pursue a career in medicine. And he was on his way to becoming a doctor, enrolled in a pre-med program. But midway through his freshman year, something happened that would set him on an entirely new path. ", " Eleven o'clock that night, the knock came. They told us that my father was found in an alley and he was murdered. I remember yelling, \"No,\" really loud.", "And my brother was going haywire and he punched a hole in the wall. And then my mother just…she started to pull her hair and she scratched her face. They found the murderers in four days. They were 18, 19 and 22. I was angry. I was very, very angry. I didn't want to retaliate. I just wanted to just ask them why. What happens to a person? Where do they get lost to become murderers. ", "At the time, I was tutoring at an after-school program for some extra money. And these kids came from the same conditions that the people that murdered my father came from. A student came to the after-school program, was probably around 16 years old. We were doing something where everyone had to read out loud, and he stormed out the classroom. And I went out to talk to him. And he just broke down. He said, “It's hard for me to read.\"", "There are many people that cry because they're hurt, they've been neglected; but to cry because you couldn't read. That spoke volumes to me. So we got him in some other programs and he start to read and it just was like this gift that money can't buy for him. And by me giving that to him, I totally forgot about the pain of the murder, and I wanted to continue to give more of what I had – to heal.", "It just dawned on me: Everybody at some point sits in a classroom. That could be the foundation for everything else. So that's when I said that whatever happened to my father is not gonna be in vain. I'm gonna follow my heart and become a teacher.", "[MUSIC – Max Richter “Vladimir's Blues\"] ", " Cailey, you had the chance to talk to Ayodeji while you were working on the book, is that right?", "Yes, so one of my other roles here is fact-checking, which is something that we do with every story, whether it goes on air or into a book. We really want to make sure that we're representing people's stories accurately. And it's also a way to involve them in the process. So, I call up participants and we go through every line of their story together. And it's fun, because they get a chance to tell me some stories that didn't make it into the interview. And they're also often digging through old photos and paperwork while we're on the phone together. One of the things that Ayodeji sent me is a questionnaire that he gives to his students on the first day of school. He's now a full-time English teacher at a high school in a suburb of Chicago. And he's in a district where nearly a third of kids live below the poverty line. And he puts a lot of effort into getting to know them from Day One. ", "So what are some of the things that he asks them? ", "Questions like, “Do you bring your own lunch to school?\" “Who do you know, other than a teacher, who has gone to college?\" “Do you have at least one adult that you feel safe with?\" And, “What was one thing a teacher did that disappointed you?\" From these pretty simple questions, he's gleaning more information about his students' lives than they might even realize. ", " So, we've got one last story to listen to from. ", " Yes, and it's from the “Dreamers\" section, which is the first section of the book. ", " The story comes from Jacksonville, Florida and the Ortega RiverBridge. This drawbridge has been open since 1927, and thousands of people cross it each day, but very few of them ever notice the bridgetender. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this person sits inside a tiny booth, opening and closing the bridge so that boats can pass through.", "Barb Abelhauser became a bridgetender there after leaving an office job that she totally hated. And at StoryCorps, she told a friend, John Maycumber, that she thought she'd only work on the bridge for a year, but wound up staying eight.", "The pay's horrible, the benefits are worse, but I have the most gorgeous view in the entire city. I mean, executives who make hundreds of thousands of dollars do not have my view. And I'm getting paid to stop and look. That's the thing I think I love the most about this. ", " And you must see a lot of things that the most of us miss.", "You know, I think about that a lot because I've been sitting in the same exact spot for all these years and I see the passage of the seasons. I see the alligator that hangs out below my window and when she lays her eggs I hear baby gators barking. ", "And people don't even realize we're there. They'll walk past us and say the most intimate, private things and we hear them. People go on dates on these bridges and they propose. So you get this little tiny snapshot of people's personal lives that they don't even realize that they're giving you. ", "There was a fisherman that used to come through the bridge every morning like clockwork. I never knew his name. You know, we had a connection but we don't really know who each other is. And one day he came through and I waved. And I found out in the news that maybe ten minutes later, while he was on his boat heading out to fish, he had a heart attack and passed away. His boat washed up on the shore of the river. He was on the boat alone, and, so, I was the last person that saw him alive. It makes you think. It makes you appreciate. ", "You know, I'll be out there at 3 o'clock in the morning, there's no traffic, it's quiet. And I'll look up and there's the moon. And I try to thank the universe once a night for this opportunity. And I think of the fact that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. And if that happens, I want have woken up that day and not thought,  [Laughs] You know? Most people don't have that. I love it.", "[MUSIC – Mermote “Monte\"] ", "Since making this recording, Barb actually moved across the country to Seattle, where she found another job tending bridges. While fact-checking Barb's story, we talked a lot about that fisherman that she mentions. And the last day that she saw him was so long ago, she didn't remember what year or even what season, but she really did remember his face, and I think the mystery of his death really weighed on her for a lot of years. They greeted each other every day and even though she didn't know his name, he felt like a friend to her. ", "When it came time to fact check this story, I did some digging to see if I could find out more about who he was. And with some help from archivists in Jacksonville, I was able to identify him, so I called Barb to let her know. And I read her parts of his obituary. And his obituary said, “He died doing what he loved best,\" and that, “that's the way he would've wanted to go.\" And I think that knowing his name and knowing that he died doing something that he really loved brought some sense of closure to Barb. She keeps a bridgetending blog and after we spoke, she wrote a blog post and in that post said, “I think it's time to lay this burden down. Maybe now we can both rest in peace.\"", " So before we go, I'm curious, what did you learn from working on this book?", "So working on a book about work and now talking with you about my work on a book of people talking about work has given me a lot of opportunity to reflect on my own work life. But if there's one thing that I've learned from all the stories in this book, it's that there's no one right way to find meaning in work. And that's really reassuring. I might not find my dream job right away, I might stumble across something, a passion of mine years from now. That's a wonderful thing, to feel like you don't reach a point in life where you've missed the boat. And so, it makes me excited for the rest of my life.

What if we actually take a step or two toward that person we consider our opposite? What will we find if we take the time to ask them some questions about their lives?", "Our hunch, maybe it is more of a hope, is that a StoryCorps interview could be kind of like a tool, something that can help people understand each other a little bit better.

They're personal and they'll focus on the experiences and the people that influenced and shaped how we see the world.", "Second, these aren't arguments and there's no winner and no loser. They're about trying to see the other guy's point of view.", "And third, you don't have to change your mind, and neither does your interview partner. It's about trying to understand, which is not the same as agreeing.", "Among the first volunteers to do this were two of the hosts of : Kai Wright and Charlie Sykes.Indivisible", "Both are super passionate about their politics, but by way of very different places.

Charlie starts the conversation.", "CS:I always described myself as a recovering liberal,  ‘cause I actually grew up in a very liberal, democratic family. My father was the chairman of the Wisconsin Civil Liberties Union, my first campaign was setting up the the campaign headquarters for Eugene McCarthy, who was the anti-war candidate against Lyndon Johnson.", "Kai Wright (KW):When you said, that you were raised by people from the ACLU…", "CS:Yeah.", "KW:…my eyebrows went up very quickly, I did not know that. At what point did you say, “I don't think I believed what I believed yesterday?\"", "CS:Part of it was I became a newspaper reporter and I covered urban issues. And I started noticing that a lot of the programs from the Great Society were just failures. And one of the things that influenced me was the whole question of are we actually supporting policies that are helping people or hurting people?", "KW:For me, it wasn't, this has rarely been an ideological question or a policy-driven question. My parents could not go to the bathroom in the same place as your parents could go to the bathroom. And that's only one generation ago. That's what shaped my worldview was being raised by those kinds of people who had that kind of life experience. And I think that is, uh, a profoundly different starting point on politics than the idea of what's happening to other people.", "CS:No, I, obviously. And I think that, you know, perhaps at one point Jews might have felt the same way. You know, my father actually was a Jewish World War II veteran, fighting in World War II, where Jews were being annihilated.", "KW: May have shaped his liberalism at the time.", "CS:Very much so. Let me tell you, though, about one of the formative parts of my view that I think is very different than yours. For me, what Martin Luther King, Jr. said about looking forward to a day when my children are judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character was one of the formative things for me — the belief in the color-blind society: that at some point, you move beyond that and you judge people by the content of their character…", "KW: See that's a…", "CS:What's wrong with that?", "KW:That's a great example that that's what you heard Martin Luther King say, because that's not at all what my parents heard Martin Luther King say or what I heard Martin Luther King say. His message was justice, not colorblindness. Martin Luther King never said that we should not see race. He also said that repeatedly that we had to undo the injustices that we'd already spent 200 years creating. To put it another way, for me, too, you know, my parents, they put me in white schools. And from the beginning they said listen, that means that you are in a place that is not built for you to succeed. And so, when you go about making your choices, be clear: you will have greater fall than your white peers if you make a mistake. These were things that were delivered to me, time and time again, frankly as I would screw up. Right like, that's not teaching me to be a victim.", "CS:Right.", "KW:And these things informed my politics. That was teaching me to be clear-eyed about what you face and then go out and be individual Kai Wright.", "CS:Well, you know, as I was listening to your story Kai, I was thinking that, in terms of what shaped my worldview, it would be my parents. I can't imagine being the same person without them.", "KW:Are they still around?", "CS:No, and they have not been for some time, no. I miss them everyday.", "KW: You know, my grandmother, passed, uh, two years ago. She is a towering figure in my life. And much of my politics were shaped in her parlor. She sort of convened the world in that parlor, uh, and people had conversations like these. And, anyway, when my father died which was, uh, I was 30 at the time. He died a young man. He and my grandmother lived together at the time, and I would, uh, talk to them regularly on the phone. And I remember leaving her house after his funeral and she says to me, she says, “well, Kai, you gotta still call.\" And you know, I called some, but, I didn't… nowhere near enough.", "CS: You know what? I can so relate to you. My father also died young. He died when he was 63, which is actually one of the reasons I retired from my radio show because I figured, that, you know, I'm roughly his age now. And I never had the chance to say goodbye, never had that last conversation, and those are the regrets that stay with you an awful lot, you know?", "KW: In talking about our life experiences what you're hearing is that we were talk to respect people and to respect ourselves. And, like, we can debate what is the best way to care for people — that's the kind of debate that both you and I want to have.", "CS: Your point about respect, I think, is fundamental here. And this is something that I try to tell conservatives is, first of all, look, if you start the conversation basically going, “I hate you, I want to deport your mother, and, um, you know I think you're less than human. Would you like to hear my ideas about the flat tax?\" Well, you know what, no! Now on your side, if you say, “Hey, I think you're a bunch of redneck bigots, would you like to hear my idea about education reform?\" Well, no, because the conversation stops…", "KW:I couldn't agree more…", "CS:If you start with the basis of respect… but that is one of the casualties of where we're at right now.", "KW:You know, I respect your thoughtfulness, Charlie. I mean, you take your politics, and your ideology, and the world very seriously. And I've learned in the course of this conversation that's because it's rooted in this respect for other people.", "CS:Well, I'm going to bear some of that back. The story that you're telling about the values you got from your parents and the struggles that you've gone through, I mean, this is very, very real. It's not just a series of political declarations, you know? And I do think that, you know, that sort of passionate engagement of your own personal experience makes it impossible not to pay attention to what you're saying. And I think back on my life and I think that perhaps I've approached politics and some of these issues maybe too intellectually, too abstractly, as opposed to cutting through all of it and saying look, we're talking about real human beings. So I'm grateful to you for this dialogue.", "[MUSIC Weinland, “For Land, For Love, For Time\"]", "MG:That's Charlie Sykes and Kai Wright, hosts of public radio's .Indivisible", "[MUSIC]", "So we played that conversation on air and we asked listeners to write in and tell us who they would want to interview. We're still combing through all the responses we got, but I do want to share one of the conversations that's already been recorded.", "It's between two people who, when it comes to talking despite political differences, they seem to  have figured something out.", "Cindy Brookshire works at the town Visitor Center in Selma, North Carolina, population roughly 6000.

And then I had remorse, I was like, I offered him a ride to vote.", "EJ:But conservatism is not a dirty word. Liberalism is not a dirty word. I can respect liberal all day long. What I have a hard time swallowing is extremism on both sides. But someone who is a liberal, I can learn from it.", "CB: Why do you think it's easy for us to talk to each other about politics when we're so different?", "EJ:Because I think we respect each other. I respect your experience. I respect your opinions.", "CB:See, I feel like I can talk to you because you don't dismiss me as a liberal. After the election, I panicked and you were the one that talked me down. And it would seem like I would go to my liberal friends to be comforted, but I went to a conservative.", "EJ:And I said, “Honey, it's going to be ok.\" We've had bigger bumps than Donald Trump. But I still know a lot of people that are still in that fetal position, but you've…", "CB: I marched on down to the democratic…", "EJ:You've marched on.", "CB:I've joined the democratic party, I'm filling out postcards to welcome new members and everything and you haven't turned away from me because of…", "EJ:No, that's your bailiwick.

Roebling's Sons Company factory'the steel and wire mill that produced wire rope that supported some of the world's most famous bridges and buildings (including the Golden Gate Bridge, and the original elevators in the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building).George's father also worked in the factory, and when his son expressed an interest in quitting school to following in his father's footsteps, it was made clear in no uncertain terms that his father was not going to allow that to happen.George came to StoryCorps to remember his childhood, and the one man who towered above all others in a town full of tough men—his father.Our next story is from George Caywood, 67, who was the director of the Union Rescue Mission, one of the oldest homeless shelters in Los Angeles, California.His work helping people in need in his community was hard, but it was not his only tough job; he also raised four daughters while struggling with depression. His oldest daughter, Gina (pictured together in the player above), came to StoryCorps with her father to remember how frightened she was by her father's depression and how challenging it was to hear him crying through the night because he was terrified to go to work and face another day.Our final Father's Day story comes from the StoryCorps app. Earlier this year, with her father in the final stages of lung and liver cancer, Eva Vega-Olds used the app to record their last conversations.Leonardo Vega (pictured with Eva at left), 73, in hospice care at his home in New Jersey at the time, was so weak that he could barely muster the strength to answer his daughter's questions. When he was healthy, he used to worked multiple jobs including the graveyard shift at a factory leaving their home just as Eva returned from school. Then later he would leave for a second job as a custodian.Eva recalls his life being defined by the work he did to support his family, and while he got weaker as he approached the end of his life, Eva says she and her father had never before spoken in depth about death—until these conversations. Still, Eva asked the questions she wanted answered and used their time together to tell her father how much he has meant to her and how much she admires him."]}

Humayun Khan, in Iraq in 2004, the term Gold Star family has been in the headlines. Gold Star describes the loss of an immediate family member serving in the military during wartime, and in this week's episode of the StoryCorps podcast, we hear from some of those families as they discuss the sacrifices they and their loved ones have made for their country.In January 2005, First Lt. Travis John Fuller and 30 others were killed in Iraq when their helicopter crashed in a sandstorm. Months later, his older sisters, Rebecca Fuller and Jenny Francis (pictured at left), came to StoryCorps to remember Travis as a little guy (he was five feet seven inches tall) much smaller than many of his fellow Marines, but who left a big impression on both his family and the people who knew him.Growing up, Monica Velez was a mother figure to her two younger brothers, Andrew and José “Freddy\" Velez (pictured together in the player above), who both left home at an early age. Freddy joined the Army when he was 18 and deployed to Iraq, when Andrew turned 18 two years later, he followed his brother into military service and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.Corporal José “Freddy\" Velez was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. He was 23 years old and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for outstanding service.Specialist Andrew Velez had the difficult task of escorting his brother's body back to the United States. Two years later, he committed suicide in Afghanistan. He was 22 years old. Before he died, Andrew received the Army Commendation Medal.Monica came to StoryCorps with her fiancé, Christopher Hernandez (pictured together at left), to remember her brothers.The Gold Star originated during WWI when families who had sent a son or husband off to war would hang a Service flag outside their home. The flag would have a blue star on it for each person in the family at war, and when someone was killed, the blue star was replaced with a gold one.Staff Sergeant Tracy Johnson is an Iraq veteran and an Army widow. She is also believed to be the first gay spouse to lose a partner at war since the repeal of “Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"On Valentine's Day in 2012, she married her long-time partner, Staff Sergeant Donna Johnson, and in October, Donna was killed by a suicide bomber while stationed in Khost, Afghanistan.At StoryCorps, Tracy talked with her mother-in-law, Sandra Johnson (pictured together above left), about finding out that Donna wasn't coming home, and they discuss Tracy's relationship with Donna's family.Lance Cpl. Brian Parrello was the only member of his Marine platoon who didn't make it home from Iraq. While patrolling near the Haditha Dam, Brian, 19, was killed by an IED.In the decade since Brian's death, his platoon has grown close to his family. Recently, Sgt. Kevin Powell sat down with Brian's mother, Shirley Parrello (pictured together at left), for a StoryCorps interview to talk about finding Brian after the explosion, and the immense guilt he has felt since.A couple of months after their conversation, Brian's platoon joined the Parrello family to mark the ten-year anniversary of Brian's death."]}

In this episode, we hear a sampling of stories recorded this year, along with a special request for your help in finishing one of those stories.StoryCorps' Digital Editor, Andrew Goldberg, guides us through the recordings, highlighting what makes the StoryCorps app interviews unique. In one example, a 16-year-old interviews her younger brother who is autistic and communicates using sign language. During their conversation, she asked him questions, he signs back his answers, and she translates them for those listening to their recording.Many of these interviews were recorded just weeks after a very contentious presidential election, so we offered some questions in the app for people to choose from on the topics of voting and the elections. These elicited a number of conversations about race, and people talking about how changes in this country will affect their lives moving forward as well as how past changes in the country affected their lives. One high school student in West Virginia learned that the first time her grandmother voted was when that state was still segregated, in 1960, and she cast her vote for John F. Kennedy. While a grandmother recounts for her granddaughter the first time she experienced racism growing up in Texas.Our final story features 94-year-old Dr. Joseph Linsk who shares a painful memory from his childhood. When he was 8 years old, he stole money meant for his family's maid, Pearl, and when the money was not found, she was fired and could not find another job to support herself and her children. But Dr. Linsk's account is only half of the story and it left us wanting to know what happened to Pearl following the incident. Dr. Linsk does not remember her last name nor does not know what happened to her or her family. We do know that Dr. Linsk grew up on Atlantic Avenue in the Uptown section of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the early 1930s, and that Pearl had children so we assume that she was of a certain age, but without more information about her, we unable to track her down.So that is where you, our listeners, come in. If you think you know who Pearl is, or know someone related to her, please get in touch with us. We hope to find someone willing to talk to us about her, and if we do we will share that story with you in a future episode."]}

So I was not excited about being Officer Clemmons at all.", "There was one particular scene that Fred and I did, where he had his feet resting in this plastic pool on a hot day.", "And he invited me to come over and to rest my feet in the water with him.", "The icon Fred Rogers, not only was showing my brown skin in the tub with his white skin as two friends, but as I was getting out of that tub he was helping me dry my feet.", "And so that scene touched me in a way that I was not prepared.", "I think he was making a very strong statement. That was his way. I still was not convinced that Officer Clemmons could have a positive influence in the neighborhood and in the real world neighborhood, but I think I was proven wrong.", "Karl Lindholm (KC):You were on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for a long time.", "FC: Yeah, I discovered a friend for life. I'll never forget one day I was watching him film a session. And you know how at the end of the program he takes his sneakers off, hangs up his sweater and he says, “You make every day a special day just by being you, and I like you just the way you are?\" I was looking at him when he was saying that, and he walks over to where I was standing. And I said, “Fred were you talking to me?\" And he said, “Yes, I have been talking to you for years. But you heard me today.\" It was like telling me I'm OK as a human being. That was one of the most meaningful experiences I'd ever had.", "[MUSIC – François singing “There are many ways to say I love you…\"]", " That's François Clemmons, best known for his role on “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\" He was speaking with his friend Karl Lindholm in Middlebury, Vermont. And we're hearing François sing right now", " Yeah, and this song is actually from the second time they did the scene. The first time was 1969, and then they did it again in 1993, for Officer Clemmons' final appearance on the show.  ", " Okay, so we have to talk about something,– the biblical imagery in this story. Now, Fred Rogers was actually a Presbyterian minister, so the idea of washing the feet, right, in the Bible, Jesus washes his disciples' feet. Fred Rogers would have been very aware of what he was doing and what it looked like.", " You are absolutely right. And actually, François talks about this in his interview. It was not lost of François what these sort of spiritual overtones were.", " And at the end, when Mister Rogers says to him, “I've been speaking to you this whole time.\" I mean, I grew up watching Mister Rogers and that's what watching the show felt like.", " Exactly. Every single kid felt like they were the only person watching that program. Mister Rogers was talking directly to me. And at the end, also, when you hear Mister Rogers say to François, “Do you have time to sing a song for my friend and me?\" That gets me, because, I mean, I – that's how I feel when I'm watching it, I know that's how most kids felt.", "So, the first time they did this scene was in 1969. And I think the context is really important. Because we're at the tail end of the 1960s, and in the past year, Martin Luther King has been assassinated, and as François mentions in the piece, you know, the whole country has seen on TV and in the newspaper, images from Bloody Sunday, from Voting Rights demonstrations, from sit-ins.", " Yeah and it's worth mentioning the significance, specifically of pools. I mean, swimming pools were famously segregated, and many protests took place around them. In fact, you know, when this scene aired in 1969, it was on the five year anniversary of a protest in St. Augustine, called a wade-in. And you know, whether or not Fred Rogers or François knew that is up for debate. You know, it could have just be a coincidence, but if it was intentional, it would have made what was already a powerful statement more so.", " And you actually produced a story a couple of years ago about the St Augustine wade-in, and we're going to hear that now.", " Yeah, so in June of 1964, J.T. Johnson and Al Lingo were two of several black and white protesters who jumped into the whites-only pool at a motel in St. Augustine. And at StoryCorps, these two came to talk about how the owner of the hotel tried to force them out by pouring acid into the pool.", "Al Lingo (AL): He really lost it.", "J.T. Johnson (JTJ): He did. Everybody was kind of caught off guard.", "AL: The girls, they were most frightened and we moved to the center of the pool.", "JTJ: I tried to calm the gang down. I knew that there was too much water for that acid to do anything. Also knew we wasn't gonna be in there long, that someone was gonna drag us out of there. When they drug us out in bathing suits and they carried us out to the jail, they wouldn't feed me because they said I didn't have on any clothes. I said, “Well that's the way you locked me up!\" But all of the news media were there because somehow I guess they'd gotten word that something was gonna happen at that pool that day. And I think that's when President Johnson got the message.", "[Archival audio of President Johnson]: Our whole foreign policy and everything else could go to hell over this. Yesterday in the swimming pool in St. Augustine they started pouring acid in the pool.", "JTJ: That had not happened before in this country, that some man is pouring acid on people in the swimming pool. But it was just something that had to happen and it happened. And I'm not so sure the Civil Rights Act would have been passed had that not been a St. Augustine. It was a milestone. We was young and we thought we'd done something ' and we had. But about 40 years later, I went back to St. Augustine. And there's a Hilton Hotel where the Motor Lodge used to be. And I sat and talked with the manager. I said to him that, “You know, I can't stay in this hotel. You don't have any African Americans working here.\" He said, “Well I promise you that next time you come down here it'll be different.\" He immediately got busy. But he was one of the few people in St. Augustine, I think, that did some of the things that we had been talking about. So, to go back to St. Augustine and it's still somewhat the same, now that does make me feel bad. The lifting is still kind of heavy, but I'll continue to work as hard as I can as long as I live. I won't ever stop, and I won't ever give up.", "[MUSIC]", " That's J.T. Johnson and Al Lingo talking about trying to integrate a pool in St. Augustine, Florida, back in 1964.", "So going back to François in “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,\" another thing about the time and the context that we're talking about, you know, the late sixties. It's really a bold casting move to have an African American man play a police officer on your show.", " Right, and François was also gay, and he came out to Fred. So Fred knew this and Fred kept him on the show, which was, you know, kind of a big deal in the sixties.", " So, it's clear their friendship went way beyond their on-screen relationship.", "Yeah, they were really close, I mean, they spent holidays together,– Christmases, Thanksgivings. François had a really illustrious career outside of “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.\" He was a professional opera singer, he won a Grammy in 1973, his love for old spirituals led him to found the Harlem Spiritual Ensemble. And you know, every time that François would debut somewhere, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers were sure to be there.", "[MUSIC]", "He was also an artist-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont for many, many years. And joining us now is another member of the production team here at StoryCorps, Cailey Cron. Cailey, you went to Middlebury?", "Yes, I did.", "What sort of figure did François cut on campus?", " Doesn't he wear purple? All the time? Everyday?", " He wears purple very often. It's a royal color. And so, I remember him saying once, “Do you know why I'm wearing purple? It's how you know who a real queen is.\" So, he was this vibrant presence on campus. He was best known, because he directed the spiritual choir. And they were such a motley, unexpected crew of characters,–", "Like, who were they?", " The football players. You had some of the hockey bros. You know, you'd have these big, beefy guys next to, you know, like, the freshman chemistry major. And they'd be up on stage swaying back and forth singing. And it was a really surprising moment, one that I, I think only François could have pulled off.", "And he retired in 2013 and you were there when that happened.", " Yes. It was a little bit like Michael Jordan's retirement, you know, François had this big concert and then he was back on campus afterwards. Shortly after that, I graduated and we had François come back to sing at our graduation. That's something he'd done every year was to come and sing the alma mater for the graduating class. Before François could start the alma mater, a few members of my graduating class stood up in the audience and started singing, “This Little Light of Mine,\" which they'd learned from being in spiritual choir with him. You know, more students started standing up, parents, faculty burst out into this rousing rendition. And François, at first, I think, was taken aback. But then, he jumped into the role that he was meant to be in and started leading the song.", " So he was the little light in Middlebury?", " Absolutely, a big light.", "So while we were working on the piece this week, you had the pleasure of getting to talk to him on the phone and email with him. What was that like for you?", "It was great. I mean, he talked to me about life in Vermont, which I miss a lot, he talked to me about his dog, Her Royal Highness, Princess Nepal, who's another important figure on campus, I would say. And the way that he signs off his emails, his tag line, I think is very emblematic of who he is, too,– Your writing, singing, acting, officer, diva man, etcetera, exclamation point. Ten exclamation points.", "[MUSIC]", " Well, Cailey, thanks so much for giving us a peek into François' other neighborhood in Middlebury, Vermont.", " Thanks for having me.", "And Jasmyn, thanks so much for bringing us these pieces.", "My pleasure.", " That's it for this episode of the StoryCorps podcast. The stories were produced by Jasmyn Belcher Morris with help from Andrés Cabellero. The podcast is produced by me and Elisheba Ittoop.", "Special thanks to Jane Klain, researcher at the Paley Center for Media, who helped us confirm that Officer Clemmons was indeed the first recurring role for an African American actor on a kids show. We'd also like to thank the Neighborhood Archive for helping us get the Mister Rogers audio you heard in this episode, and the Fred Rogers Company for sharing a really great photograph of Fred and François during the pool scene in 1993. Head to our website, StoryCorps dot org, to check it out. And there, you can also find out how to record your own interview.", "And one last thing, we have a favor to ask this week. It would be super helpful to us if you could write a review of this podcast on iTunes. See, the more reviews we get, the more people will find out about the podcast.

Chris always knew there was something different about her youngest child; assigned female at birth, Gabe always felt like he was a boy.Following his seventh birthday, Gabe convinced his parents to let him cut off his long hair and get a Mohawk. He also started dressing only in clothing often designated for boys while answering both publicly and privately to “he\" and not “she.\"Gabe came to StoryCorps with his mother to talk about what it's been like for him to be transgender, and his fears about the future.After the interview, Von Diaz who produced the piece joined the podcast to provide an update on Gabe's life since his story aired in May on NPR.Our next piece comes from the early days of StoryCorps. In 2004, Kaitlyn Sever, 10, came to StoryCorps with her mother Lynn (pictured above). Lynn, who is gay, wanted to ask her daughter questions about her future: What do you want to be when you grow up? Who would you like to marry? Do you want to have kids?When she was done, Kaitlyn turned the tables and asked her mother questions as well'the most pointed being, “How has being a parent changed you?\" Lynn's answer is both honest and touching.Finally we hear from MJ Seide and 12-year-old Genna Alperin (pictured at left). When MJ and Genna's grandmother, Marty Jacobson, fell in love with each other, MJ explains to Genna that Marty was the first person who ever proudly told her that they loved her. With their shared love, it took no time for MJ to become a part of Marty and Genna's tight family.MJ and Genna came to StoryCorps so that MJ, also one of Genna's favorite grandmothers, could share stories of love, family, and roller coasters.Their first interview was recorded in 2010, and recently, MJ was invited back to StoryCorps with Marty to talk more about their love story and some of the things MJ wishes she had done differently."]}

Whether it was feeding strangers during the Great Depression, offering friendship to another parent in a similar situation, or going beyond the requirements of their jobs to look out for those most vulnerable, all of these people were looking out for others.Our first story comes from our archives. In 2005, Laurel Kaae brought her mother, Virginia Fairbrother (pictured at left), to a StoryBooth stop in North Dakota. At the time, Virginia was 81 years old, and when Laurel asked her who had the greatest most influence on her life, she did not hesitate to name her father, Homer Hill.Virginia grew up during the Great Depression, which began after the stock market crash in October 1929. Like so many others, her family had very little, but they were fortunate because her father owned the drugstore in town. At StoryCorps, Virginia tells her daughter a story about the day a stranger showed up at their doorstep looking for some help for his hungry family and what her father did.Next is a recent story told by two fathers who are both raising children on the autism spectrum. One of them, Charles Jones, has a 12-year-old son named Malik, the other, Anthony Merkerson, has two children on the spectrum, Elijah, 10, and Amaya, 8.Years ago, Charles (below right), a filmmaker, started a support group for fathers like himself to provide them a space to feel safe sharing their feelings, and five years ago, at a New York Mets game on Autism Awareness Day, Charles met Anthony (below left), a police officer for the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City. Anthony joined Charles' group and they have since become close friends.They came to StoryCorps to talk about what they have learned from one another, and the concerns they have for their sons as young black men growing up in a society where they are at constant risk of being targeted and misunderstood because they are autistic.Our final story takes place in a California nursing home called Valley Springs Manor where Maurice Rowland (on the left in the player above) was a cook, and Miguel Alvarez (on the right in the player above) was a janitor.They were at work one day in 2014 when the company that managed the home abruptly shut it down leaving many of the elderly residents with nowhere to go. When the staff stopped getting paid, they abandoned those living in the home'all except Maurice and Miguel. The two of them stayed at work for days caring for the remaining residents, and at StoryCorps they recall the decision they made to remain until the fire department and the sheriff came to take over.This incident led to legislation known as the Residential Care for the Elderly Reform Act of 2014, which protects residents from being abandoned after a shutdown."]}

You might remember him as Ross Perot's running mate in 1992 and his disastrous performance in the vice presidential debate. His opening statement became a punchline on late night TV.", "Vice Admiral James Stockdale: Who am I? Why am I here? [Applause and laughter].", "MG: But Stockdale's legacy goes way beyond that soundbite.", "He's actually Vice Admiral James Stockdale and he was the highest ranking naval officer to be held as a POW in Vietnam.  His plane was shot down in 1965 and he was captured and brought to the infamous prison known as the “Hanoi Hilton.\"", "He spent seven and a half years in prison and his son, Jim Stockdale, was a teenager when his father first went missing. When he sat down for StoryCorps, he talked about how his family spent those years waiting for his dad.", "Jim Stockdale (JS): At one point while dad was gone, mom decided that we would not take any family pictures. She just said it one night at supper and we nodded knowingly as though that made sense. And she decided that she would buy no new clothes until dad came home. There was also a point at which she decided that we should always have a small bowl of rice for supper and that's all, to sort of share dad's meager existence.", "These sound like strange ' they are, they're, they're emotional kinds of things that really indicated how desperate we were to do something, you know? How we might live our lives in waiting.", "I at one point visited a counselor, probably five years in. And the one piece of advice I remember was, “You may be better off just considering your father dead and gone.\" Which, at the time, made pretty good sense to me. You know? After years and years of living with it.", "The day that dad came home — we had been forewarned about dad's injuries — but standing there on the tarmac, when he came down the a…came down the steps, I remember just holding his featherweight frame in my arms. We were just sort of stumbling over our love for one another.", "And I remember the third night he was actually at home he wanted to go and call the, ah, wife of one of the men who had died in prison. And, ah, we had about one of those to do a night for a couple of weeks. He felt it was his obligation to report what he knew about the nobility of men who had suffered greatly and had died of injury or infection or, in a couple of cases, just a broken heart as he described it.", "And we realized how close we had come. And, uh, we maintained a fierce, loving allegiance to one another through to the very end.", "[MUSIC – “Demus\" by Charles Atlas]", "MG:That's Jim Stockdale remembering his father, Vice Admiral James Stockdale, who was a POW in Vietnam.", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG:Joining us now is the producer of this story, Alletta Cooper.  Hey, Alletta.", "Alletta Cooper (AC):Hi, Michael.", "MG:So, Alletta, we heard about the family back home and what their experience was like while Stockdale was in captivity.  But can you tell us a little bit more about what he went through as a POW?", "AC: Yeah, you know, as you mentioned before, he was the senior ranking officer held as a prisoner of war and he was a leader among the other American POWs.  He, for almost four years, was in solitary confinement, but he managed to come up with a code, a tapping code, to communicate with some of the other prisoners.", "MG:Like what?  They'd tap on the wall or something?", "AC: Yeah, they'd tap on the walls so they could hear each other because they really weren't allowed to communicate when they were held in these camps together.  He also came up with a code of conduct so that they wouldn't be used for propaganda videos, and he went so far as to slash his own face with a razor blade so that he wouldn't be on video for propaganda against America. And the scars are visible in the pictures taken right when he got back from being a POW in 1973.  ", "MG:So we know that eventually he ended up on a presidential ticket, but could you tell us a bit more about when he first came home? What was it like?", "AC:When he got home he'd lost more than 30 pounds, he had a stiff leg, he had a bad back, but his health was overall pretty good, all things considered. And he stayed in the navy for another six years, retiring as a Vice Admiral in 1979.  And in 1976 he was given the Medal of Honor, which is the military's highest award.", "A lot of people kind of expected things to fall apart for him and his relationships after having been a POW and in solitary for so long. But he came home to his sons who he had only known as little kids and really was able to show up for them and build these incredible, lasting relationships with them, as you hear in the piece. And his wife, Sybil, and he were really a solid team and they were able to continue that partnership.", "Our storyteller, Jim, talks about when his family was reunited on the tarmac. But Sybil actually had a phone call with her husband before that moment. And it was recorded without her actually knowing it.  One of her sons bought this phone recording device from a mail order catalog and secretly hooked it up to the phone before this phone call happened.  And we have that phone call.  This is the first time that Sybil and James spoke  to each other in more than seven years.", "Sybil Stockdale (SS): Jim?", "James Stockdale (JS): Syb?", "SS: Can you hear me?", "JS: Very well.  Can you hear me?", "SS:Yes.", "JS:I love you so.  And I am so proud of you.", "SS:Oh, I love you, Jim.  Are you alright?", "JS: Yes, I am.  I've got a stiff leg and a bumped shoulder, but I wouldn't worry about either.  It sort of gives me a little style. I'm really in a fairyland here and I think I'm picking up right where I left it.", "SS: Well that suits me fine.  ", "JS: I wanted to know if there's something you'd really like to have in the way of a gift.", "SS:No.  Just you.  I just want you to come home and get to know the younger boys who are just beside themselves with anticipation.", "JS: Yes, and I'm going to spend more time with each of those fellows.", "SS:Jim?  ", "JS: Yes?", "SS: It doesn't seem possible, does it?", "JS: No, it doesn't.", "[MUSIC – “M Laurelle\" by Robin Allende ]", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG:So there's really this kind of amazing love story embedded in here.", "AC: Yeah, you know, there really is. You can hear in the phone call how much they care for each other. Even when her husband was a POW, Sybil and he were a team.  She didn't actually know he was alive until seven months after he first went missing.  And she found out because she actually received a handwritten letter in the mail from him that had come from Vietnam through the US postal service with stamps from Vietnam.  No one really knows how that happened, but it ended up there at the house.  ", "Here's Jim again.", "JS: The letters contained some things that were somewhat disturbing and some things that seemed mysterious to mom and me as she laid them out on the card table and we read them together.  There were allusions to persons and places that didn't make sense in context in the letters.  And we were a little unsure whether that meant dad was losing it or perhaps he was sending a cloaked message. Fortunately, it turned out to be the latter.", "AC: So, as you can hear, it was Sybil who actually discovered that these letters were coded.  And she worked with the CIA to send coded messages back and forth with her husband for the entirety of his captivity.  ", "So Sybil was truly a hero in her own right.  And aside from the coded letters, she was a fierce advocate for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action.  And she really helped get rid of the “keep-quiet\" policy around the conditions of the captured soldiers.", "MG: Wait, what do you mean a “keep-quiet\" policy?  I've never heard of that.", "AC:So, at the time, the government was telling families of people who were missing and prisoner that they shouldn't talk to anyone about that and about the conditions of the prisoners or anything like that.  And the Pentagon kept reassuring the families that everything's fine, Vietnam is abiding by the Geneva Convention, everything's wonderful.  But these letters that Sybil was exchanging with her husband, these coded messages were clearly indicating that that actually wasn't the case.  He was describing torture, which clearly violated the Geneva Convention.  And Sybil just wasn't going to have it.  And she was this incredibly proper Navy wife, self-described, but she really wasn't going to let this policy continue on her watch.", "JS:Mom applied her considerable social skills.  And don't forget, this is a time when Navy wives wore white gloves and were supposed to be proper and relatively obedient.  She broke through that pretty quickly and was invited to some luncheons where some of the people who were denying her the information would sit politely and, you know, use the right fork for salad.  But that didn't stop her from saying, “You need to communicate more and better,\" and, “you should be helping us.\"  And finally she broke through.", "[MUSIC – “Mangata\" by Jon Luc Hefferman ]", "AC:In 1979, Sybil received the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, which is the highest award that a civilian not employed by the Department of the Navy can receive.", "MG: So are James and Sybil still living?", "AC: Sadly they are not.  Although they did remain married until Vice Admiral Stockdale died in 2005.  Sybil died in 2015 and they're buried next to each other at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.

In 2007, he recorded an interview with his granddaughter, Sydney Reed.  And he told her that, even though he's one of the top ranking Democrats in the House of Representatives today, his journey to Washington was not easy.", "Sydney Reed (SR):Have you ever felt you wanted to quit?", "James Clyburn (JC):Oh absolutely. When I first won in 1970 – when I won the primary of the South Carolina House of Representatives – there was this big party after the votes came in and everybody was jumping up and down and very happy. But the next morning, I went into the bathroom and there on my sink was a little note from your grandmother. And the little note said, “When you win, brag gently. When you lose, weep softly.\" And I thought that was kind of interesting. And I stuck it up on the mirror in the bathroom. So we go into the general election in November, and when the polls closed that evening around 10 o'clock, all the news media announced that I had gotten elected – that I was going to be a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. About 3:30 in the morning, somebody rang my doorbell, and they told me that something had gone wrong down at the courthouse. And I went down to the courthouse and they told me rather than winning by 500 votes, we have determined that you have lost by 500 votes. The next morning when I went to my bathroom, I looked up at the mirror and I wept softly. And yes, I thought then that this was the worst thing [that] could possibly happen. But later on that morning, I determined that I was going to go forward.", "In 1978, I ran for Secretary of State – and lost. Eight years later, in 1986, I ran for Secretary of State again – and lost. And um, more than one person said to me, “Well that's your third strike. What are you going to do next?\" And I always said, “Three strikes may be an out in baseball, but life is not baseball.\" And so in 1992, I ran for the United States Congress. And this time, I won. I don't know, there was just something that kept telling me that you got to stick this out.

While we're now pretty confident that'for better or worse—we seeing the real thing, this week's episode of the StoryCorps podcast takes a look at a time when that was certainly not the case.In 1964, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona ran against Democratic incumbent Lyndon Johnson. LBJ had assumed office following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and went on to win in a landslide. But there was another candidate in the race who has largely been forgotten by history: Mrs. Yetta Bronstein, a Jewish housewife from the Bronx with a son named Marvin who played the drums—badly.Created by professional pranksters and husband and wife team Jeanne and Alan Abel, Yetta came out of their Chicago nightclub act and ran as an independent write-in candidate from the fictitious “Best Party.\" Her platform included national bingo, sixteen ounces in every pound, and lowering the voting age so juvenile delinquents would have something to do. She also wanted to take Congress off salary and put them on a commission, and while she had no problem with gun ownership, she did want to decrease the velocity of bullets by 95 percent.Jeanne Abel pretended to be Yetta for interviews with reporters, while Alan was her campaign manager. Together, they duped radio and television journalists using a photo of Alan's own Jewish mother in their election materials. Yetta lost to LBJ in 1964 and to Richard Nixon in 1968, in between she also ran for mayor of New York City and for a seat in Parliament.The Yetta Bronstein hoax is just one of scores of pranks the Abels orchestrated over the past sixty years. The one they may be best known for is attempting to advance the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals (SINA), which aimed, in the name of morality, to put pants on the world's creatures. SINA's slogan was, “A nude horse is a rude horse.\"Fake lectures at prestigious universities, a fake documentary about President Nixon, the list of pranks the couple pulled on the public is at times unbelievable. Proving that for them no prank can go too far, Alan once even faked his own death, leading to a January 2, 1980, obituary in . Two days later, for the first time in their history, the newspaper of record retracted an obituary explaining, “An obituary in The New York Times on Wednesday reported incorrectly that Alan Abel was dead. Mr. Abel held a news conference yesterday…\"Producers Michael Garofalo and Alletta Cooper traveled to Connecticut to record this interview, and once inside the Abel's charming New England home, they saw towers of boxes filled with the evidence of decades of hoaxes and pranks and then conducted one of the most freewheeling, raucous StoryCorps interviews ever."]}

I'm Michael Garofalo.", "We're just days away from the 2016 presidential election.  And if we've learned anything during this campaign, it's how deeply divided we seem to be. For people on both sides it can seem like the other side is living in an alternate universe, right? I mean, if you look at those red versus blue Facebook feeds, you're probably shocked at how far apart we are on seemingly every issue. It's like there have been these two stories running parallel to each other and rarely, if ever, do they meet.", "We've been talking about this a lot here at StoryCorps. We've been saying that maybe the most important conversations we could be having right now are the ones that just aren't happening ' between people who can't see eye to eye.", "Now, in most StoryCorps conversations, the two people talking really aren't in conflict. Maybe they were in the past, but it's been resolved and they're reflecting on what happened. But we wanted to know what would happen if two people, in the midst of this divisive election, who were in almost complete disagreement, tried to do a StoryCorps interview.", "And we wondered, what if the conversation weren't about policy points or ideology? What if the conversation wasn't about trying to win an argument? What if we sat down with someone whose political leanings seem totally incomprehensible to us, and we try to understand where they are coming from? Maybe you think that's a little idealistic or naive, but who knows, it might move us forward a little bit. It might be a little grease on the gears.", "So, we went looking in the place where these kinds of conversations can get the most heated: families.", "Of course, conventional wisdom says you don't talk politics with family. If you vote Democrat and your brother votes Republican, just avoid the topic at all costs for the sake of peace. But we put a call out on social media for people who disagreed with a family member about politics and might be willing to sit down with them. One of the people who responded was Jenn Stanley.", "Jenn is 29.  She's a writer and she's liberal.  And, full disclosure, she used to work at StoryCorps, though she doesn't work here anymore. Her father, Peter, works construction in Boston, and he's conservative. They've been fighting a lot about politics this election season and it's taken a real toll on their relationship.", "So, just last week, they recorded a conversation about why they've been fighting so much, and to try to find some common ground.", " I try to not bring up politics. But you always watch like the 5 o'clock news and the minute any politician steps on, it doesn't matter who it is, I just cringe and…", " Me, too. [laughs]", ": Yeah, but you have to say something, whereas I would like to just pretend it's not happening…", ": Well, you're the adult.", ": [laughs] You're the adult! I'm the child.", ": Oh, ok. I, I think I get that from my father. I remember him watching the Watergate hearings, glued to the TV, calling everybody a liar and… [laughs]… So maybe the answer is we don't watch the news while you're there.", ": Maybe.", ": You know?", ": But now I feel like we've gotten to this point where we're together and we are fighting about politics.", ": And those would be the times when I hear you say, “I can't even talk to you, Dad.\" And to be honest with you, I get a little bit miffed when you say you can't talk to me, but I… if you're going to get so angry and and flip out about it then, you know what, I'd rather you didn't talk to me.", ": But see, this is what drives me crazy, though. Because you… you… I am not the only one yelling in our conversations.", ": I definitely voice my opinions…", ": But you start these conversations…I", ": Well, I ask questions. What do you think about this and what do you think about that? It's me trying to glean information from somebody who is significantly more educated than I am and whose opinions I trust. I don't think I intentionally talk about politics with you to get into an argument with you.  ", ": I'm really surprised to hear you say that. I had no idea that you were genuinely interested in what I had to say. I thought that you wanted to hear what I had to say so that you could tell me how I was wrong and also make a joke about how I was silly.", ": Well, I would never feel that way about you. I have nothing but respect for you. I don't agree with you all the time, I don't agree with you most of the time, but that's ok.", ": One of the things we disagree on… it's about guns. And I want to understand why it's so important to you.", ": You know, when I got out of the service after the Vietnam War, I started target shooting. And I think the draw for me is I find it extremely relaxing, because to do it properly you have to have total concentration, you're not thinking about the bad day you had at work or the guy who cut you off in traffic. So when I walk away from two or three hours at the shooting range, I walk away very relaxed.", ": It's interesting that you say that because I am somebody, very similar to you, that, a lot of stuff is going on in my brain all the time. And I think when you talk about how you leave the shooting range, that's how yoga for me is, like, really helpful.", ": We have a lot of things in common. And I do know that [laughs] I do know that everything you did when you were a little kid was because you wanted to be like me. You even played softball, which you hated, because I love baseball.", ": I did really hate it. [laughs]", ": I know. And you know what, and I coached it. And I coached it for only one reason, not because I wanted to, but because you wanted to play it.", ": I mean, I just really worshipped you, Dad. I just thought that everything that you thought and said was right.", ": Um-hmm.", ": And you were just my best friend. But I think as I got older, I realized that you were really wrong about a lot of things.", ": Well, you're probably right, Jenn. I'm not… I never professed to be right about everything. The important thing here to me in our relationship is that you have your own beliefs and that I respect you for your beliefs. You were raised to be a sensitive, caring person and that's exactly who you are.", ": You say that, and I feel loved.  But I will say, I think you used to like me and I don't necessarily know that you like me anymore.", ": Oh, yeah, I like you a lot. It doesn't make me feel good that you say that. I don't agree with everything you say and do. I like being around you more when you're not correcting me…", ": [Laughs]", ": But do I like you? Yeah, you bet I do. And I'm extremely proud of you.", "You know, when my time comes, ah… to say, yeah, my father was a good man, we didn't agree politically, but, ah, he was a good man. And if you can say that, then, I'll be happy.", ": I don't think that you're right all the time, but I think you're the best man.", ": Thanks.", ": And you're the best dad.", "[MUSIC – “You Know Who You Are\" by Alan Singley]", ": Jenn and Peter Stanley in Boston, Massachusetts.", "Jenn now lives in Chicago. And in the interview they talked about something that I think is actually a really common dynamic in working class families. When Jenn went to college, that's when Peter feels like she changed her views and became liberal. And Jenn talked about how going to college and living in a different city than the rest of her family makes her feel like an outsider, especially when she comes home to visit. ", "And it's during those visits that they've been having their fights.", "Well, Jenn was home on a visit when they recorded this interview and a week has now passed.  So, we called them up to see just how the interview went for them and if it had any effect at all on how they interacted with each other.", "We talked first with Peter.", ": It was a little intense at times.  Whenever you hear one of your children telling you that there's something about you that they don't like, it's not pleasant.  And that would be the most difficult part of the conversation for me.  ", ": Do you think having done this conversation that it will have any effect on the way you guys talk about politics going forward?", ": Oh, I think Jenn will understand that when I ask her questions, I'm not trying to make fun of her or trying to goad her into arguing.  Hopefully, she understands that now.  And I will be a little more careful in the things that I say.", ": What advice would you give, or words of wisdom would you give, to another parent who is having these kinds of arguments with their kids right now?", ": It's simple. If, you know, your child is your child. You love them. And if you love your child, you love them for who they are. It doesn't matter what they think politically. You know, it's who they are. And have respect for their opinions and listen to what they have to say. I was raised that way. My dad didn't always agree with me, but he listened to what I had to say and respected my opinion. Maybe I'm not always successful, but I try.", ": Are you glad you had this conversation with her?", ": Yes, I am. I was a little apprehensive about how it was going to turn out, but in retrospect, I'm glad I had the conversation because in the future, I think our conversations could be a little easier, maybe a little less heated, and a little healthier.", "[MUSIC – Scott Holmes “Nights with Amber Lights\"]", ": Next, we called up Jenn. And when I told her what her dad said about it being more intense than he expected, she had a slightly different take.", ": I actually thought that the interview was way less intense than it was going to be. Because I was afraid that we were really going to get in a big fight and start talking over each other, which is how it usually goes with us. I felt like we were both pretty restrained. Part of why I wanted to do this interview is my family is, I just don't think is always the best at communicating with each other. We talk about stuff and we're close. But I wanted to do this interview to be with my dad in a space where he could hear me and I could hear him and there would be somebody there making sure we were listening to each other.  ", ": So do you feel like something different happened in this conversation?", ": Yeah, I do. I was very surprised to hear my dad's motivation for trying to talk to me about politics. I guess that kind of reminds me of our relationship when I was younger.  ", ": How so?", ": You know, because my dad and I used to talk a lot. I think my dad wanted an audience for his thoughts and I was an intellectually curious child. So, it kind of felt more like that again. It felt like we were getting to the bottom of things instead of just yelling over each other.", ": What was the hardest part of this interview for you?", ": I find it really painful to talk to my parents about things that maybe aren't working in our relationship or that I think they do wrong because I don't want to hurt them. I say it because I want things to be better and I want things to be honest between us. But I don't want it to come off as just hurtful and I think it really did hurt him. And I really hate that something I said hurt him.  ", ": Right. Well, he ultimately told us that he was really glad he did it.", ": Oh, good!", ": Are you glad you did the interview?", ": I really had a great experience. I think it was difficult — it was emotionally difficult. I felt a little weird for the next couple of days, thinking about it.  ", ": I don't know if you saw him again during that trip to Boston or not-", ": Yeah, I was staying with them.", ": I mean, was the news on? Was there anything slightly different about your interaction?", ": I would say, we certainly didn't fight. I did finally ask him who he was voting for, which I would normally say but I won't because my dad doesn't like to talk publicly about who he's voting for. He thinks that's private information. I tried not to be too upset about what he said, but I wasn't thrilled with his answer, I should say.", "But I just feel like I want to have real moments of understanding with the people that I love and I want to look back and see that we made progress. And, ultimately, at the end of the day, we really love and care for each other.  ", "[MUSIC – Nick Jaina “All the Best Fakers\"]", ": We owe a big thank you to Jenn and Peter Stanley for taking this on.", "And we want to hear from you. Is there someone in your family you can't agree with? Someone you're always getting in arguments with? Leave us a voicemail and tell us how you handle it. And let us know if you'd be willing to try to do a StoryCorps interview like this one. The election, hopefully, will be over on November 9th, but these divisions won't.", "The number to call is the number to call is 301-744-Talk. That's 301-744-T-A-L-K. You can also leave a message for Jenn and Peter or anyone else you hear on this podcast.", "[MUSIC – Jean Luc Hefferman “A Storm at Eilean Mor\"]", "That's all for this episode.", "I produced this story with help from Alletta Cooper and the podcast is produced by me and Elisheba Ittoop.", "Thanks so much to PRX, the Public Radio Exchange, and their podcast garage in Boston, where we recorded Jenn and Peter.", "Rate or review us on iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts, and head over to our website, www.storycorps.org, to schedule your own interview.", "Until next time, I'm Michael Garofalo.", "Thanks for listening.", "[MUSIC]"]}

These are stories about taking the long view and sticking it out, and times when persistence and patience paid off.Our first story comes from Bob Heft (pictured above). He was interviewed at his home in Saginaw, Michigan, surrounded by dozens of American flags. Bob has a particular claim on our current flag: he designed it as a high school student for an American history class assignment. There was a problem, though'Bob's flag had fifty stars on it, and, at the time, there were only 48 states. He had a hunch that more would be added soon, and it turned out, Bob was right. Bob went on to become a public school teacher, college professor, and mayor of Napoleon, Ohio, before he passed away in 2009.It started in 1958 at a roller-skating rink on the Indian Head naval base in Maryland, where Peter Headen met a girl named Jackie (pictured together at left). He introduced himself, and so began a love story that spans one war, three countries, and four decades."]}

And then, for the first time ever, we're going to listen to some of the voicemails that you guys, our listeners, left for people you heard on this show.", "But first, the stories.", "We'll start with one about a trade ' and a way of thinking about work — that's been passed down from father to son.", "Phil Mortillaro and his son, Philip Jr., run Greenwich Locksmiths in Manhattan's West Village. If you've ever been to New York and taken a cab down 6th Avenue, you may have noticed their squat, one-story building on the West side of the street. The exterior is covered with these intricate designs made entirely of keys.", "Anyway, the Mortillaros came to StoryCorps to talk about locksmithing, which the older Phil has been practicing since leaving school after the eighth grade.", " I was one of those kids who would show up when school first started. And they would see me again around Christmas time. And then they would see me in June to tell me that I had to do the grade over again. So dropping out of school was, it was inevitable. And as far as you doing the business? You started younger than me.", " As soon as I could walk. Even before you were walking. Yeah, I… I've got pictures of you in the shop when you were in the bassinet. I was literally there since day one. I saw you do it, I was like, \"Ok, I can do this.\" Then I kind of realized, man, you know, everyone loves my dad. One half of that is, you know,  ‘cause he's a great guy, but the other half is, like, he's the guy who helps you when even other locksmiths can't help. I have a sense of usefulness. And that's a big thing in my noodle, you always have to feel like I have some worth. I'm not just saying this, you're the most hardworking, tenacious person I know and… That comes from coming from immigrant parents. You can never work hard enough. Even when you're working seven days a week they say, “You're a little lazy.\" Think about it Philip, when am I ever late? Never. When do I ever take vacations? No, never. And when am I gonna retire? One day before your funeral? You know it. Yup. [Laughter] You know if you ever didn't want to do this, you know, I would never be heart broken. I would understand. Yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? My father, he hated my business man. You know, I had a cousin who became an accountant, and my father used to tell me about him all the time. But um, I think it was the, the founder of IBM, he said: \"I'm no genius, but I'm bright in spots, and I stay around those spots.\" I like that. You raised all of us, man. Five kids and every single one of them did not ever want for anything, man. That's hard to do for someone who just went up to the eighth grade. Well, you do your best kid. This is what you do. But honestly your best. Not just your B.S. best. And even if you fail. It doesn't feel that bad. You're always my barometer. You never let anyone down. That's what sets you apart.", "[MUSIC – Podington Bear “Saunter\"] That's Phil Mortillaro with his son Philip Jr. in New York City.", "One of the first things our parents give us is our names.", "That's pretty much all that 10-year-old Ibukun Owolabi has to remember his mom by. She died suddenly and unexpectedly when he was only two weeks old. Ibukun's teenage sister, Alice, then stepped in to help raise him. And a decade after their mother's death, Alice brought her brother to StoryCorps so he could find out more about their mom.", " It's still really hard to talk about her, because her passing was around the same time as you being born, so it's like…", " …A happy moment and a sad moment. Yeah, but in the two weeks you guys were together, she was always kissing you and always holding you, she did love you a lot. Do you think that you two have any similarities? Yeah, I probably get my stubbornness from her. Definitely, you got that from Mommy. She wanted you to have a Nigerian first name, and we were like, “Let's just make it easy and give him an English name.\" So everybody decided on Jacob, but with your name, and just anything in life, if she had an opinion, she wasn't going to back down. She was like, “My son's name is Ibukunoluwa.\" And your name means Blessing from God. Do you think Mommy made the right choice in naming you? Well, I like my name but not really other people do. Wait, what do you mean? Oh, well they just make fun of it. If you could go back in time, would you want us to change it? No. Why not? Cause then it would probably change everything up to now and right now I'm living a pretty good life. Well Ibukun, this is the longest conversation we've had about Mommy, so if there's anything you ever wanted to ask… I can ask it now?: Yeah. Okay, what was your favorite memory of Mommy? Huh, I have a lot. I remember I was like 10, I was in 4th grade. Wait, how old are you? 10. Yeah. I skipped kindergarten so…: Well excuse me… (Laughs) She was a nurse, she worked the night shift, and so she came home really late. I came over and I took off her shoes and I gave her a foot massage. I remember she was telling the person on the phone how nurturing I was. And, now I'm a teacher, and any time someone asks me why I'm a teacher, I'm like, “I'm nurturing.\" That's exactly what Mommy said about me.

I was quite happy with the looks. I got a few wolf whistles.", "[MUSIC]", " So, the bra had the desired effect at first. But pretty soon, Betty got some attention that she really didn't want.", " That year I took a trip to South America. I proceeded to fly to Santiago. Soon we were into the Andes mountains, and it turned out that it was a non-pressurized plane. And I felt very uncomfortable. Things were getting very tight. This bra had started to increase in size. As the thing got bigger, I tried to stand up and I couldn't see my feet. The directions said it would go to 48 if I wanted it to. I thought what would happen if it goes beyond 48. And I found out what happened. It blew out. It was a loud resounding sound and the co-pilot came into the cabin with the gun wondering what had happened. The men all pointed to me.", "Well it's difficult to explain to people in English that part of your anatomy just blew up, but to try to do it in Spanish it's beyond hope.", "So they made a landing. I was taken off the plane and turned over to two women police. And they told me to strip, hunting for what they thought was the bomb. When I stripped down, I showed them the hole in the bra and they chuckled, and I thought, oh my, they've gotten the point and I was allowed back on the plane.", "A month later, I got a bill from the airline for four hundred dollars for an unscheduled stop.", "[MUSIC – Broke For Free “Only Knows\"]", " Betty Jenkins. She was 94 when she recorded that story. She told us that her mother found what happened to her so funny, that she kept that bra as a reminder of the story until she died in 1967.", "So, you may have some questions about this bra. We did, too. Could this really happen?", "Well, we did some research and found inflatable bras and breast pads date back to the 19th century. You can see, for example, US patent 146,805.", "We also talked to a historian of women's undergarments, Jane Farrell-Beck. She's the co-author of \"Uplift: The Bra in America\" and a retired professor of Textiles and Clothing at Iowa State. We ran Betty Jenkins' description of the bra — it had a straw that went into the cup and you would blow into it to inflate it — we ran the description by her and she was able to tell us that yes, those bras were on the market then. And they were made from material that is much more delicate than what bras are made of today — they could tear or rip pretty easily.", "Lastly, remember that this was 1940 — and Betty was not in an airliner like we think of them today. It wasn't pressurized. So we called up John Hansman, a Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and he confirmed that yes, an inflatable bra like this one would expand during flight in an unpressurized cabin — especially at the altitude required to fly above the Andes Mountains — and, depending on the material, it could possibly explode.", "Over the past couple of episodes I've mentioned that we now have a phone number you can call and leave messages for people you hear on the show. Well, our episode about Gold Star families — those are families who lost someone at war — and this episode went out a couple of weeks ago — inspired a lot of you to call in.

We've recorded interviews with rescue and recovery workers, police officers, firefighters, and in this episode of the StoryCorps podcast, we hear from an American Airlines employee who unwittingly checked in two of the hijackers on 9/11.On September 11, Vaughn Allex was working the American Airlines ticket counter at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. He was just wrapping-up the check-in for Flight 77 when two men who were running late came to his counter.Vaughn looked over their IDs, asked them the standard security questions'everything that a ticket agent was supposed to do—and the two men then passed through and made the flight. It turned out that those men were among the five hijackers who crashed Flight 77 into the Pentagon, killing 189 people including themselves.In his interview, Vaughn told his wife, Denise (pictured together above), about how that morning has haunted him ever since.

This got us thinking about fair play. In this week's episode of the StoryCorps podcast, we dig into our archives to share stories about people who did things the right way'even if they did not always end up like they hoped. (Plus voicemails from you, our listeners.)Our first story comes from Bill Sayenga (pictured at left). He came to StoryCorps with his daughter to record memories of his mother, Marie, who worked as a secretary making about $2000 a year in the small coal-mining township of Bethel, Pennsylvania. In 1949, she decided to run for political office and set her eyes on becoming tax collector.For more than 50 years men ran the county tax office, and her opponent in the election had been in charge for nearly half that time. Marie lost the first time she ran, but in the next election she won by nine votes, and taught her son a valuable lesson about fair play.Marie went on to win five subsequent elections before retiring from office in 1978 after 24 years of service.Our next story comes James Lacy (pictured below), who was 90 years old when he recorded his interview in 2008. Growing up in Sidney, Texas, his father, Jim, ran a successful general store. But when the stock market crashed in 1929, everything changed. Before the crash, his father had been quick to extend credit to anyone in need, but he soon found himself struggling to pay his suppliers. Friends tried to get him to file for bankruptcy, but he refused, and everything he owned was repossessed.James' father spent the next 20 years working to pay off debts while raising eight children. He remembers his strength and humor and how people in his community talked admirably about him and his values.Our final story comes from Boulder, Colorado. In 1975, Clela Rorex (pictured below) was a newly-elected county clerk when she began issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples. She told her friend, Sue Larson, how it started one day when a gay couple came to her office asking for a marriage license.Not sure if she could issue the license, she went to the district attorney and learned that the state marriage code did not specify marriage as being between a man and a woman. A stickler for the law, she issued the marriage license and immediately found herself under scrutiny by opponents of gay marriage with hatred and threats not only aimed at her, but at her 8-year-old son as well.While she was not re-elected, she has always been happy that she made the decision to issue the licenses since it was the right thing to do.In October 2014, same sex marriage became legal in Colorado.This week we end with voicemails left by you, our listeners, for Alex Landau. In “,\" we heard from Alex, an African American man who was beaten by Denver police during a traffic stop in 2009.We listen to all of the voicemails that come in, and in each episode of the podcast we share a few with you.

They are also trying to figure out how they fit in. Confidence has a huge impact on how well a child performs in school, and in this episode of the StoryCorps podcast, we hear stories about people attempting to find their place.Our first story takes place in 1953 as A.P. Tureaud Jr. was beginning his freshman year at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The first time he applied he was rejected based on his race (LSU was then an all-white school and A.P. is black). His family filed a lawsuit and won making A.P. the first black undergraduate to enroll at LSU.At StoryCorps, he talked with his friend Steven Walkley (pictured together in the player above) about how miserable he felt when he first arrived on campus, and how hard the other students made life for him. At one point A.P. considered dropping out, but a chance encounter with a father and son inspired him to stay in school and earn his degree.Our second story is about a community of students who made a place for a fellow student who many wanted to cast out. John Graziano (pictured above), was in second grade at an elementary school in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette and had been sick for most of his childhood. It was 1986 and no one could figure out what was wrong with him. He had been adopted by the Graziano family and they eventually came to learn that John had contracted HIV from his biological mother.Tom, John's father, spoke with John's elementary school principal, Paul Nilsen (pictured together at left), about how protective John's fellow students were of their friend and classmate in the face of fear and pressure from their wider community.John died in 1989, just days shy of his 10th birthday.Our final story begins in a classroom but does not end there. Eileen Kushner grew up in Detroit during the 1950s and always had trouble with reading and doing simple math. She remembers being made fun of by other children in school, but what Eileen did not know was that she was struggling with a learning disability.Married out of high school, she had three children and hoped that as a stay-at-home mom she would be able to hide her difficulties, but money was tight so she was forced to look for work.Encouraged by her husband, Larry (pictured together at left), Eileen eventually found work at a Chicago-area McDonald's and did such a great job that she was promoted to work the register. Convinced that she would have to quit her job, Larry helped her find an innovative way to overcome her learning problems and excel.Eileen was eventually promoted to manager, attended Hamburger University, and she and Larry went on to own five McDonald's restaurants.Lastly, we check in with you, our listeners, and the voicemails left for , a former American Airlines employee working at Washington Dulles International Airport who checked in two of the 9/11 hijackers on September 11, 2001. Vaughn spoke about that day and what it has been like for him for the past 15 years. Many of our listeners left encouraging words for him and shared how his story affected them."]}

And this one comes from the New York Aquarium, which is just off the boardwalk at Coney Island. And fun fact: it's actually the oldest continuously operating aquarium in the US. Anyway, that is where Hans Walters and his wife, Martha Hiatt work. He's a shark biologist and she's an animal behaviorist.", ": And they recently came to StoryCorps to talk about the path Hans took to his career, which is actually pretty unusual.

When I was five, we were getting ready to leave the beach and lo and behold, there was a dead shark laying on the beach. And I said, “Mom, I wanna take the shark home.\" So my mother helped me schlep this three foot shark into the backseat of the car. And I'm one of six kids and we all had our snow cones and the dead shark with the windows shut and it stank. We all got sick. I remember upchucking my banana snow cone in the backseat of the car.", "So when I got to college I was studying marine biology and I'd sort of accepted my nerd-dom, you know? I think I had to play catch up in the interaction with members of the opposite sex department. Which is the main reason I joined a rock band.", "And we did pretty well for nine years. But at that point I was 30 and decided maybe it was time to find something else to do. That's what led me to the New York Aquarium.", "When I got there they would call the sharks Sand Tiger 1, Sand Tiger 2, Sand Tiger 3. And I just started calling them names of dirty, rotten, stinkin' rock and rollers.", " So you went with Guns N' Roses…", ": Yeah, this one's Axl. This one's Duff. And then we got another group of  ‘em and we went with AC/DC. So there's Guns N' Roses and Bad Company are in one pool, and AC/DC and Janis Joplin are in the other.", ": I love when one of the keepers says to another, “OK, I'm gonna go feed Guns N' Roses.\"", ": Or, “Who's feeding the band?\"", "About three or four years ago, Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, he came to visit. And we were hanging out on the Coney Island boardwalk and he said to me, “When the music ended for you, you kind of fell right into marine biology. I always thought that was really cool that you had a backup plan.\" And I said, “No, you know, music was the backup plan, marine biology was the original plan.\"", ": So, your mom, she obviously knew you became a marine biologist. How'd she feel about it?", ": She was thrilled. Her thing was, and she always said this from as long as I can remember, “Find something you're interested in and stick with it.\"", "That was it. Not, “Grow up, get a job and make a living.\" ' “Find something you're interested in and stick with it.\" And everything came full circle.", "[MUSIC – Guns N' Roses “Sweet Child O' Mine\"]", ": That's shark biologist Hans Walters with his wife, animal behaviorist, Martha Hiatt, at StoryCorps in New York City.", ": You were telling me that Hans still plays music?", ": Oh yeah.  He still rocks in his free time.  He's had a few bands over the years, and even toured with Dee Snider's side project, Van Helsing's Curse.", ": Okay, but going back to ZToyz, his first band, what do we know about them?", ": Well, Hans was in the band from 1982 until they broke up in  ‘91. And ZToyz toured with bands like Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Cheap Trick. They even had a video on MTV as part of the Basement Tapes competition, which was kind of like a star search program for bands that provided their own music videos. And the video was for a song called Miami Breakdown, which was their most well-known song. And it's pretty amazing.", "[MUSIC – ZToyz “Miami Breakdown\"]", ": You actually got to go to the aquarium recently, which I was incredibly jealous of, and there are some photos from that visit on our website. What was it like to see Hans and Martha in their element?", ": It was a real privilege. I mean they are pretty much the coolest couple on the planet. You've got this former rocker caring for sharks — badass. You've got this brilliant woman training 400 pound sea lions — badass. And they come to work together, they go home together, they inspire each other, respect and support one another. It was pretty awesome to see it firsthand.", ": And did they meet at work?", ": They did. And that's a whole other story. Luckily, they talked about this in their StoryCorps interview. Here's Martha.", ": The first time I saw you, I was feeding some whales. And I looked over at one point and I saw this guy with hair down to your waist. You just stood out in the crowd. But you know I gotta be honest, I was married at the time, so I wasn't looking at you like, oh he's cute — although you were. But a short time later I wound up going through a divorce, which was one of the low points in my life. And I remember moping around and one day I was washing a bucket, and you handed me a milkshake.", ": Milkshakes make me feel better. I figured they'd make you feel better, too. I guess I was right.", ": And after a few more milkshakes, that's when I started noticing just how good you look in a wetsuit.", ": Well, you know, I never wanted to be married. But I did want to be married to you. That's a huge distinction. When we moved in together, one of the things that struck me is — all of the other relationships I'd been in, there was her CDs and his CDs and never the twain shall meet. But when we moved in together, you couldn't tell where your CDs left off and mine started. And it was amazing.", ": You know, we're pretty lucky. I didn't think I could find someone who would understand why I was on-call 24 hours a day, because who does that except for a doctor. But then, you did understand that because you do the same thing.", ": You were always thrilled when we'd go to a bar somewhere and I'd sit in with the band. Or whenever I'd say you know I need to get back into it, I want to form another band.\"", "You weren't always like, “Aw why do you need to do that?\" You were like, “Yes let's do it. What can I do to help?\"", ": So that was your chocolate milkshake?", ": That was my chocolate milkshake, that's right.", ": [Laughs].", "[MUSIC – ZToyz “Cindi\"]", ": Hans and Martha are really a kind of perfect match — not just for each other — but also for a StoryCorps interview.", "We rarely know the story of how someone ends up doing an interview, or if we do, it's really not that surprising: so and so heard us on the radio and they wanted to interview their mom, or someone at StoryCorps reached out and invited a community group or somebody with an interesting story to participate. But sometimes, people give us tips. And that's what happened here.", " Yes, hi, my name is Nathan Morris. I'm a PhD student in biology. And I am the Morris in Jasmyn Belcher Morris, a producer here at StoryCorps.", ": Yeah, so full disclosure here, that's my husband. And he found Hans and Martha — completely by chance. As he said, he's a grad student in biology and he came home one day and as soon as he walked in the door, he, of course, said, “I met someone today who HAS to do a StoryCorps interview.\"", ": So, I sat down with Nathan a few days ago to get that story.", ": The lab that I'm a member of was on a field trip to the New York Aquarium and we were being shown around the sharks. And the person giving us the tour mentioned that the sharks at the aquarium were named after rock musicians. I asked how they got those names and was told that it was a person by the name of Hans who was also a former musician himself. And thinking back to who we met earlier, I was pretty sure I knew who the rocker was.", ": How did you know?", ": We can just tell each other. [laughter] I, myself, am also a former rock musician.", ": What was your band?", ": I used to be in a band called Polar Bear Club. And whenever you hear a story about a former musician being in an interesting line of work it always kind of is like, oh, cool that guy made it out and ended up doing this. And it was just really nice to hear about another person who ended up in biology.", ": I find it really interesting that you said, “somebody who made it out.\" People think of being in a rock band as really glamorous.", ": Yeah.", ": Right?", ": And, sure, and for some people, it definitely is. But the thing is that once you're in that world for years and years it's harder to find other types of work, because that's all you know and all you have any training in.", ": In what ways do you feel like being in a rock band prepared you for biology?", ": It made me used to not making much money. [laughter] ", "When you're trying to make a living making music, you really have to do it because you have a strong passion for it. It requires lots of time and dedication and it's a lot of hard work for an unknown future. And in many ways biology is like that, where, being a graduate student, you have to be passionate about what you're studying.", "[MUSIC – Podington Bear “Fives\"]", ": It's funny, you know, in one conversation I had with Hans and Martha, Hans was saying, “no matter what you decide to do in life…trust that you're the expert.\"", "You know, like he was saying his path was super unique, he's probably the only rocker biologist out there. But Martha was quick to correct him and point to my husband. And suddenly there was competition.", ": Well, maybe there's a future in the sciences for all those former rockers or indie hopefuls, aspiring producers, or whatever. This could be the start of something.", ": Maybe. It all goes back to what Hans' mom told him. Pick something you're good at and stick with it. Some advice I've gotten from women in my family: whatever you are, be a good one.", "[MUSIC – Podington Bear “Good Times\"]", ": That's all for this episode.

How about Alex? What else can you tell me about him?", "LA: Alex's parents told us that their son was just that type of guy who could make friends with anyone. Tom and Alex loved hockey, for example. And when they were at the games Tom said you could turn away for just one second and next thing you know, Alex would be down by the glass making friends with the zamboni driver.", "MG: The zamboni is that thing that cleans the ice, right? That machine?", "LA: Right. He'd be interested in the guy driving that, or getting signed posters from the backup goalie. He just loved people.", "[MUSIC Blue Dot Sessions “Lacquer Groove\"]:", "You know, that night, Alex was at the movies with a group of friends — they took up the whole 12th row of the theater. And Alex's parents said he was the person who could get other people excited about things they may not have cared about. So he gathered a bunch of his colleagues from the restaurant he worked at and they all went together. But when they looked at their tickets, they realized that some people in the group got split up into a different theater. So, Alex, being the guy he was, exchanged everyone's tickets so they could all be together in the same screening. He didn't want anyone to be left out. But tragically, that theater they all moved to is where the shooting took place.

Here's Tom.", "ToS: Six of his friends were shot. One of his friends had three of her fingers blown off of her hand. And it was all so random. It was — if you sat here, nothing happened. If you sat there, you know, you were killed.

And they escaped the theater safely. ", "MW: And, actually, we spoke with Maria on the phone to find out more about what happened when her son met Alex and gave him the hat.", "Maria Carbonell (MC):He was like, “Hey! You know, I know you really love Batman. I was able to get this for you.\" And I remember my son was like…he looked a little shocked.

Please, when you guys are done documenting evidence — please, can I please get that hat back?\"", "MG:So, did they ever get it?", "MW:Yeah. Eventually Maria got it back from the crime scene. And she gave it to her son.", "MC:He took the hat to his bedroom and hung it up right next to his bed. And that's where it stayed. And he still has it. And he was wearing it the other day. [Laughs]", "LA: That wasn't the only gift that passed between Maria and Alex's families. Maria and her son went to Alex's wake. And Armondo told Alex's dad how, that night at the movie theater, the two of them bonded over their love of the superhero, Green Lantern. And then, Armondo gave Alex's dad a Green Lantern comic book as a gift. He was really touched by that and he still has it today. ", "MW:And the wake also had a really important impact on Maria and on Alex's mom, Terry.", "MC:I remember walking up to Terry and I just started to sob. And I said, \"I am so sorry that you lost your son and that I still have mine.\" And I remember when I told her that, she just grabbed me and um…just squeezed the dickens out of me. And she — she gives the best hugs. And all I felt was warmth, and kindness. That was probably one of the first things that actually started my healing, was that hug from Terry.", "[MUSIC Lee Rosevere “Memories Again\"]:", "MW:That was a real turning point for Maria. In fact, in the months that followed, she would go on to find a new calling as a counselor helping other people work through their trauma.", "MC:I went from serving tables to working into the mental health field.

Using my story from the theater shooting to help others.", "[MUSIC]:", "MG: So, guys, we're coming up on July 20th — do you know what Alex's family, or Maria and his other friends, are doing to mark it?", "LA:Yeah, we asked Tom and Terry what they plan to do this year and they're still a little unsure if they're going back to the theater. You know, for them, it really depends on how they're feeling on the day of the anniversary. ", "MW:As far as his friends, Maria told me that they get together at Alex's favorite bar on every anniversary and toast to his memory. I guess when you have this larger than life friend who had a gift for bringing people together, the best way to remember him is to do just that.

The raiding of gay bars was common at the time, but what was uncommon this time was the reaction.What began with a drag queen clobbering her arresting officer soon escalated into a full-fledged riot, and modern gay activism was born. Instead of running away, the patrons ' many of them Puerto Rican drag queens — stood up for themselves. Protests continued for six days, and the event became known as the Stonewall Riots.Today, the Stonewall Inn is a national historic landmark. But when Dave made his documentary, many of those involved in the uprising had never told their story.Initially broadcast on the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, this documentary is the first — in any medium — to recount them. It weaves together the perspectives of the participants, from Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine, who marshaled the raid, to Sylvia Rivera, one of the drag queens who battled most fiercely that night. The revolutionary impact of the riot is better understood by looking at life for gay men and lesbians in the era before Stonewall, seen through the eyes of people like Bruce Merrow and Geanne Harwood, a gay couple who have been together for 60 years, and Jheri Faire, an 80-year-old lesbian.“Remembering Stonewall\" also examines how Stonewall affected gay politics through the voices of people like Randy Wicker, the first openly gay person to appear on television and radio; Joan Nestle, founder of the Lesbian Herstory Archives; and yippie leader Jim Fouratt, who helped found the Gay Liberation Front on the third night of the Stonewall Riots."]}

But one of the hardest things was that people made fun of this person that I loved, so I wanted to protect you.", "SG: Remember when I was beat up in front of our house?", "VG: Mmmhmm.", "SG: The guy kicked my teeth in. To have your son have to witness that was pretty terrible.", "VG: Yeah.", "SG: Remember the neighbors we had? He came out with a knife one day and threatened to castrate me.

Roughly, 230 miles north of Milwaukee down a winding dirt road sits the world's largest rotating globe planetarium. What is that? What's a rotating globe planetarium? Well, most planetariums, you sit there and the stars are projected on the ceiling, right? Well, in a rotating globe planetarium, you sit beneath a giant dome that has the stars painted on it and the dome itself, through some mechanical process moves around you. So you get to see how the sky changes over the course of the night. Well, there's only been four of these ever built that we know about, and the oldest dates back nearly 400 years. But this one, the one in the woods in Wisconsin, was built by Frank Kovac, and the project took nearly a decade to complete.

A group of Boy Scouts wanted to come out and look through the telescopes that I have. It turned out to be a cloudy night, and I thought I'm going to fix that.

The dream come true.", "[MUSIC]", "MG:That's Frank Kovac in Monaco, Wisconsin. Now, I've been to his planetarium and whatever you imagine that it's like, I can assure you it's even better than that. It's astonishing that he built this thing on his own. And the pure joy that he brings to his shows is contagious. If you make the trek, which I think you should, ask for a laser light show. He does it with an old turntable, laser pointers and salt shakers. I can't really explain how, but it's amazing.

Now, let's hear from some people who took things further, people who weren't content just to look. As a teenager, Alton Yates did a job that helps send people into space. It was the mid-1950s, before NASA existed, and Yates was part of a small group of air force volunteers who tested the effects of high speeds on the body, and these experiments helped prove that space travel was safe for humans. So Alton Yates and the other volunteers were strapped to these rocket propelled sleds that hurdled down a track at more than 600 miles per hour, and then stopped in a matter of seconds. Now, Alton Yates came to StoryCorps with his daughter, Toni, and he told her that the story that eventually leads to people going into space started for him in high school, shortly after his mother died. ", "Alton Yates (AY): My dad was trying to raise the seven of us by himself. And I knew that as soon as I finished high school I was going to have to help with taking care of the family.", "Toni Yates (TY): How did you know he needed your help?", "AY: Well he came home from work, and he rolled cigarettes and he roasted peanuts and he put them in little bags. And then he left home immediately to sell those products. And I just couldn't stand to see him continue to do that. There weren't any good paying jobs just out of high school so I decided to join the Air Force. And the call had gone out for volunteers to determine the effects of space travel on the human body. So I became one of the human guinea pigs who rode high speed rocket sleds.", "TY:How old were you when you did the first test?", "AY:I was 19. And when the sled took off, it was almost as if everything in your body was being forced out through your back. And then when it stopped, it was like driving an automobile at a hundred miles an hour and running into a stone wall.", "TY: But yet you did that 65 times?", "AY:I did it more than 65 times. And let me tell you, there was something about the group of volunteers we had out there. I remember one, when they took him off the sled he was like a dish rag. The rest of us saw what happened to him but we were anxious to get strapped in to that seat to conduct the next experiment. We went up to Johnsville, Pennsylvania. They had a huge centrifuge up there. We rode that thing at high speeds. You had your hand on a little trigger and the minute you started to black out, your hand would come off the trigger and that would stop the centrifuge.", "TY: Did your dad know what you were doing? (Laughs)", "AY:He didn't know initially, but Ebony magazine published an article that showed pictures of some of these rocket sleds that I had been riding. When my dad got a copy of that magazine, he took that thing everywhere he went. And I think just to make my father proud of me was something that I always wanted to do. And I was able to do that before he passed away.", "TY: The day that man went into space, what was that like for you?", "AY: I felt a warmth come over my body when I heard the countdown. And even to this day, every time there's a liftoff, I think a little piece of me lifts off with each of those missions.", "[MUSIC] ", "MG: That's Alton Yates with his daughter, Toni, in Jacksonville, FL.

Tragically, he was also one of the seven astronauts killed when the space shuttle Challenger exploded just seconds after lift off on January 28, 1986. McNair was a graduate of MIT who had grown up in the small farming community of Lake City, SC. Now we're going to hear from his brother, Carl, who talks about how Ronald's journey from the rural south to outer space began with an act of courage at the local public library.

For Christmas time he says to me, “What was the biggest tip you ever got?\" And I says, “Well, a hundred dollars.\" And he says, “Here's a hundred and fifty dollars and merry Christmas.\" He says, “By the way, who was the one that gave you the hundred?'

And maybe, especially if you were an angst-filled teenager at the time, maybe you felt like if you could just sit down with that writer and chat, you'd become fast friends. I'd venture that probably no other 20th century-author inspired that feeling more than J.D. Salinger, who wrote The Catcher in the Rye. Of course, he was famously reclusive, but that just stoked the flame for a young man named Jim Krawczyk. In the late 1960s, he decided to get in his car, drive from his home in Wisconsin to New Hampshire, where Salinger lived, and try to meet the writer he admired most.", "[TAPE – Krawczyk]", " I don't really recall a town or anything. It was like a building with a post office, gas station, and a general store all wrapped into one. So I went inside and I told him I said, “My name is Jim Krawczyk, I'm from Wisconsin. I was wondering if you could tell me where J.D. Salinger lives.' He says, 'Ha, you're never going to see him. Even the delivery boy doesn't see him. He leaves the groceries in the garage and picks up the money in an envelope.' I goes, 'Whoa, y'know I come a long way to meet this guy.'", "So I talk to a retired school teacher. She gave me directions, further. Now this is so far back in the mountains that it was a dirt road. It was amazing I didn't get lost. I'm driving along and coming up on this house, and I look and it's his house. I had a biography of him that described where he lived and everything. I goes, 'Wow, I can't believe it, it's just like the book said.' You know, it's really neat. I wasn't afraid, y'know bashful or anything like that. I thought I'm going to be cool about it. So I parked the car, went up, knocked the door. This woman came out. It was his wife. I says, 'Hello, my name is Jim Krawczyk. I'm wondering if I could meet your husband.' And she goes, 'Anything he says, he says in his books.' She slammed the door. I goes, 'Whoa,' I come a long way, this is something. So I turned around and started to go down the steps, she open the door again and she come out to the porch. She says, 'Him and I are divorced and he lives across the road.' So, uh, I went down the road I pulled in his driveway and knocked on the door. He had a screen that was like a copper mesh and I really couldn't see in and I'm straining to see him and everything. And just then a crack of thunder came so loud, it felt like it was just above my head. And it started to rain. He came to the door, he says, 'You better come inside.' Y'know I goes, 'Whoa,' he didn't sit down or anything, he didn't offer me a cup of coffee or something, nothing y'know. Just  ‘what do you want?' And so I told him who I was, I asked him if he had ever been in Wisconsin. And he says, 'Yeah.' He's been there sometime during the war. I asked, 'Did you think the Catcher in the Rye would be such a popular book?' And I don't remember exactly what he said but I think it was, 'It's been a nightmare.' And why a nightmare? I don't know, maybe it's because he gets so much fan mail or I don't know what. I really wanted to ask him, 'Can I see where you work?' But I didn't want to be one of the phonies that he writes about. I kind of held back and I said, 'Well, okay thank you very much.' I shook his hand and that was it.

I was really lucky when I was young to get a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and that was to do something, we called it the American Folklife Radio Project. And it was these stories of characters across the country celebrating authentic everyday American voices doing kind of remarkable things. At some point in the middle of that series decided, with Harvey, to turn it into a book. I used to do these really insane trips — I mean thousands of miles, doing 2 or three stories a day– not all of them would get on the air but I would prep a region of the country and travel around and I remember meeting Virginia Belle Brewer was the last stop on a Texas trip.

But, when the brotherhood got strong we didn't have that trouble no more. I enjoyed the railroad, I did. Up until the last four or five days. I never thought that last day would get you.

And you explained last time about your partnership with Steve Zeitlin City Lore, and I think that's how this next story came to you.", "Dave Isay (DI): Yeah, almost all of the American Talkers were scouted by Steve and his team at City Lore. And this is one of them. and this is one of them. It's a guy named Reggie, although it's spelled reggie jones. Reggie jones who had been a lifeguard on Jones Beach since 1944, and he was still a lifeguard at the time", "REGGIE JONES: I started lifeguarding in 1944, and I loved every minute of it. Fortunately, I was a Depression baby, and I knew what work was, and when I got a job out on the beach sitting on the sand, I said, \"Valhalla, I have arrived!\"", "There must have been 120,130 guys trying out for this job lifeguarding. I didn't know how many jobs they were going to have, but at any rate, I started going through training down there. In those days, they didn't just give one test. You had to go down and go through three or four weeks training—and you didn't get paid. After a period of time, about two weeks or so, half of the guys dropped off, but I wanted the job so bad I stuck right with it.Finally, after another couple of weeks, there were about seventy of us left, and the old captain, Hank Daly, with a big barrel chest, stood upon the bench, and he said, \"We're going to take ten huskies.\" We all looked at each other and nearly died. I says, \"Only ten of us, after all this . . . this labor camp we've been in? We're getting ten?\" And he started to read off the names of the guys. I'll never forget it—Tommy McCormick, Moe Marrage, Billy Davoe—and with each name my heart dropped. I said \"Oh, no, no.\" And finally number nine, my old buddy, Artie Wink. And I said \"Oh, gee, no.\" And finally number ten, 'Reggie Jones.' I thought I won the Olympics. I said, \"Yes, yes! There is a god!\"Artie Wink was a young fella that I went to high school with. It was my second year on the job. It was World War II and Artie and myself, we knew we would have to go into the service as soon as we turned eighteen. Well, that summer I was sitting on 2-West with Artie—that's a stand that was two west of the west bathhouse. Artie got off the stand to go back for lunch and I said, \"Artie, will you bring me back a Jones Beach hotdog?\" You know, I was getting hungry. And he said \"Okay, Jonesy,\" and he went off. Well, somehow he never came back to that particular stand, and in a day or two, into the service he went.Well, I lost track of Artie, and I often wondered what happened with good old Artie that went into the service. Forty years later, I'm sitting on 2-West, the exact same stand that Artie got off of. I look down, and—lo and behold—walking by in front of me was Artie Wink. Now, you understand, this is forty years later, and somehow I recognized him. He had come back to settle his mother's estate and he was with his twenty-five-year old daughter, and he was pointing out to her where he worked as a young man. When I looked down and saw him I said \"Artie, Artie Wink! Where's my hotdog? I'm sitting up here for forty years; where have you been?\" Well, you ever see a guy take a double take? This was a triple take. \"Jonesy!\" he said. He literally gasped for air. He said, \"I can't believe it! You're still here?\" I said, \"Where do you want me to go? I'm getting hungry!\"[MUSIC IN – “Under the Boardwalk\" by The Drifters]", "[MUSIC OUT]", "MG:That was Reggie Jones, lifeguard.", "So, Dave, tell us about the next story.", "DI: When you told me you were doing this episode, I think I requested that you put this one in.

And this is Miguel Algarín telling the story of Mikey Piñero's funeral procession.", "MG: And he actually recites a poem in the pieces that was written by Piñero. It's the instructions for the funeral.", "DI:I hadn't heard that poem before and I completely fell in love with it. I have a terrible memory, but I memorized the poem. And at the time, I lived in the East Village on the Lower East Side, and I used to run through the Lower East Side, kind of, in my head reciting the poem to myself, and I love the way that Miguel Algarín reads it. You can almost hear Mikey Piñero reading it with the same tonality.", "Miguel Algarín (MA): MA:MA:(Drumming fades in.)We began walking, spreading the ashes, and a lot of people came into the streets and joined. The procession was from Houston to 14th on D and from 14th to Houston on C, and so forth, until second and then we came back. But towards the projects, women—old women would fall to their knees and take the ashes and make the sign of the cross. To see the junkies bow their heads and almost bare their freshly wounded vein, you know, to the ashes. There is a very famous Puerto Rican singer who's strung out, and he was on the street that day, and he broke down and cried.

And absolutely nobody disturbed him.I took care that every detail in the poem was taken care of.Miguel Algarín performing poem:Just once before I die,I want to climb up on atenement skyto dream my lungs out 'tillI crythen scatter my ashes throughthe Lower East Side.So let me sing my song tonightlet me feel out of sight…Poem:A thief, a junkie I've been…Poem:This concrete tomb is my home…Poem:I don't want to be buried in Puerto Rico…", "MA: That he didn't land up in Puerto Rico like his family might have wished, but that he landed up in the asphalt and concrete and beer can roses at the Lower East Side.", "(Drumming fades out.)Poem:So please when I diedon't take me far awaykeep me nearby.Take my ashes and scatter them throughout the Lower East Side.", "MG:Something that we've done a lot of at StoryCorps is remembering people who have died in the 9/11 attacks. Actually, you started doing that before StoryCorps even happened, back in 2001, with a firefighter.", "DI:You know, some people think that StoryCorps started because of September 11th, which it actually didn't. Although our first big initiative with StoryCorps was with the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to give everyone who lost a loved one the chance to remember the person who had been lost. I was going to work on September 11, 2001 and Harvey Wang who we talked about in the last episode, who is a photographer that I worked with for many years, was best friends with a guy named Bill Feehan. And Bill Feehan's dad, whose name is William Feehan, was the highest-ranking person in the fire department who died on September 11th. He was the only person who ever served in every single position in the fire department. He was a legend in the fire department. It was said he knew the location of every single fire hydrant in the five boroughs of New York. And on September 11th, Harvey called and said that he had done an interview with Bill's dad. He came to the office which was just above where the barricades were, that you couldn't get below, and we started editing it.

The whole department exists simply to serve the people of the city. And I know everybody hears those kinds of things and it sounds pretty corny, it sounds a little of hackneyed, perhaps, but that's the reason this department exists. Now, the thing that sets the firefighter apart is that it's he or she who, when the bell sounds, has to go and be ready at any moment to go in harm's way and to do whatever is necessary to help the person who called them.", "My father came into the department in 1926, I think, and I was born in '29.

There has to be something beyond money that makes them do that.", "This department is rich in tradition. It's rich in history. We have a memorial day, where we go up to the firemen's monument on 100th Street, and we honor all those firefighters who died in the last year, either in the line of duty or from natural causes. But we have this every single year. You know, we've had 127 years of paid fire department in New York City, and in that 127 years, we have lost 752 people. That's an awfully large number.

It was just a nice morning. It had been too quiet I mean, or something.", "MCBRIDE: Did you ever hear of anything so fascinating? And wait 'til I tell you– I understand that in this book, there's a picture of a park bench that you yourself have slept on.", "WEEGEE:That's right. I used to sleep in Bryant Park not so many years ago. That was in the summertime of course, at 6 o'clock in the morning. A cop would come around and hit the sole of your shoe with his club. I'd get up and go looking for a job. I always loved photography but I couldn't get no work. That was during the days of the Depression and so forth and I started hanging around police headquarters at the teletype desk and took pictures. I had no business there, because you're supposed to have police card or press card, but I did it two years on my nerve, then after I got a little bit known the editors of the different newspapers that I sold my pictures to helped me get a press card.", "MCBRIDE:I understand the police tailors make zipper pockets so your pockets won't be picked.", "WEEGEE:Oh yeah, oh yeah.

You don't really know what else is going.", "WEEGEE:Oh absolutely not. I just look through the wire- finder in my camera and as a matter of fact, when I really see the picture is when I've developed the film. Then I really see what I've have done.

But we would go through eh archives and look for voices–mostly they were recorded as part of the WPA, so these were the famous oral histories recorded as part of the Federal Writers Project. Studs Terkel was one of these people who did these interviews it was ethnomusicologists and anthropologists and sociologists and writers and folklorists who traveled around doing interviews. The vast majority of these were done just on paper they were written transcripts. But with some of these the folklorists would travel with an acetate recorder which was this kind of monster recorder that you put in the back of a truck that would cut these acetate disks like these huge records, this was one of the real influences on StoryCorps because they were beautifully recorded and I found with headphones on listening to these this sense of just being transported back in time.

To start with, I wasn't in the class that John Steinbeck called the Okies, because my dad to start with was worth about 35 or 40 thousand dollars. He had everything hunky-dory, and then he started having a little bad luck. In fact, our whole family had a little bit of it. I don't know whether it's worth talking about or not.

Anyway, she was having a little difficulty with her schoolwork, and she had to stay home and do some work, and she caught afire while she was doing some ironing that afternoon on the old kerosene stove. It was highly unsafe and highly uncertain in them days, and this one blowed up. It caught her afire and she run around the house about twice before anybody could catch her. Next day she died. And my mother — that one was a little bit too much for her nerves or something. I don't know exactly how it was, but anyway my mother died in the insane asylum at Norman, Oklahoma. Then about that same time my father mysteriously, for some reason or another, caught afire. There's a lot of people who say that he set himself on fire. Others say he caught afire accidentally. I always will think that he done it on purpose, because he lost all his money.", "All of my brothers and sisters, all these things happened and they found theirselves scattered. All us kids had to scatter out and be adopted by different families. I lived with a family of people. There was eleven of us, lived in a little two-room shack. We had two or three beds, you know, so we'd sleep some of us at the head and some of us at the foot, and had everybody's feet in everybody's faces. You know how that is. Then after that, I don't know, I kind of took to the road. I hit the road one day. The first day that I ever hit the highway to be what's called a rambling man or a hobo or a tramp was in 1927.", "AL: How old were you then?", "WG:At that time I was about seventeen years old.", "WG:So I went down to Galveston, Texas, hoed figs in all them orchards down in that country, helped drill water wells, irrigated strawberries, and helped a carpenter tear down a whole bunch of houses. And that time I was about eighteen.", "AL:Well Woody, did you begin to sing about this time? How did that happen?", "WG:Then I went back up into the panhandle of Texas. The big wheat belt. Up around Amarillo, Texas — north of Amarillo, Texas. When I got into that country, I got a job about the third day I was there. I got a job with a feller that owned a root beer stand, supposedly, and he said he'd give me three dollars a day to stand behind the counter and sell people root beer. So I told him I had the intelligence enough to do that. So I got around behind the counter, and he told me, \"Now, in addition to this root beer, here's some bottles of another description. If anybody comes up and lays a dollar and a half on the counter here, why you reach down and gently and firmly let him have one of these here bottles.\"", "One day my curiosity got the best of me, and I just got to wondering \"What in the devil is in them bottles?\" So I opened up one and tasted of it, and it was nothing in the world but just unadulterated corn whiskey. So, we was a-wheelin' and a-dealin' there in the whiskey business for a long time. And this guy had a guitar that laid around there, and a lot of times there wouldn't be any customers in this place, and I'd grab up this guitar and got to pecking around on it. I thought it sounded awful pretty. And learned a little old chord, just how to barely chord along, and finally learnt a just a few little old songs, and just kind of drifted into it. I never did own a guitar, though.", "AL:What were some of the first songs you began to sing out in the panhandle?", "WG: Here's an old song here, that they sing back down in that country. Almost everybody knows it. The name of this one here is \"Greenback Dollar.\"", "WG:In this part of Texas where I was working in this whiskey store, some of the worst dust storms in the history of the whole world, I guess, broke loose. Here's a picture, here, Allan — I'd like you to look at that. That there is the little town of Pampa, Texas. That's where my wife and three children are living right now. I hear from them about twice a week.", "AL: Well, what happened the night that dust storm hit? Do you remember just exactly what you people did and what you said?", "WG: Well, you see the big picture here. It shows you the big dust storm coming up and uh, you know, just to see a thing of that kind coming towards you — wouldn't know exactly what it was because it's a freak looking thing. You never saw anything like it before. But we all sat there, we had seen dust storms of every other different color, labor, description, style, fashion, shade, design, model.", "Anyway, I remember the particular evening of April the fourteenth, 1935, that this dust storm here blowed up. I was standing, a whole bunch of us were standing just outside of this little town here that you see, and so we watched the dust storm come up like the Red Sea closing in on the Israel children. Anyway, we stood there watched the sun of a gun coming up. And I'm telling you it got so black when that thing hit, we all run into the house, and all the neighbors congregated in the different houses around over the neighborhood. We sit there in a little old room, and it got so dark that you couldn't see your hand before your face, you couldn't see anybody in the room. You could turn on an electric light bulb, a good, strong electric light bulb in a little room and that electric light bulb hanging in the room looked just about like a cigarette burning. And that was all the light that you could get out of it.", "And so we got to talking to, you know, and a lot of the people in the crowd that was religious-minded and they was up pretty well on their scriptures, and they said \"Well, boys, girls, friends and relatives, this is the end. This is the end of the world.\" And everybody just said, \"Well, so long, it's been good to know you.\" I made up a little song there — kind of one of my own making.

It sounds so much like StoryCorps to me.", "DI:I think that there's a CD that may still be available on Smithsonian Folksways of the entire interview.

More after this short break.", "[MUSIC IN]", "MG: Welcome back. In this episode, we are going to hear from Thompson Williams. He grew up in Oklahoma during the 1950s and 1960s, and he was one of eight kids. His father was a towering figure in his childhood. He was a tribal leader of the Caddo Nation, a veteran of the Second World War and the most important person in Thompson's life. He died of a heart attack in 1978, before Thompson's own children had a chance to meet him. ", "And when a man of Melford's stature dies, he leaves an enormous hole in the lives of the people he mattered to. Thompson's own son, Kiamichi-tet, could sense that about the relationship between his father and his grandfather. And when he sat down with Thompson at StoryCorps, he wanted to know more. ", "Kiamichi-tet Williams (KW): I actually never met your dad, my grandfather. What was he like?", "TW:He wasn't the biggest guy but people reacted to him like he was giant. He could swear with the best of them'it sounded like music—but he never used it to be angry with somebody. I remember my mom would tell me, \"Your dad tried to spank you once, and he cried instead.\" He had a kind heart. And I remember in grade school there was a little kid; he was mentally retarded. One day, um, there was a bunch of us and we started throwing bottle caps at him. I picked one up and threw it—it smacked him in the head. I turned around and my dad was standing there. And I thought, \"Oops I'm really in trouble now.\" But he looked at me, tears in his eyes, and he said, “Maybe I didn't teach you how to look after others. That's my fault.\" You know, he could've stabbed me in the heart and it wouldn't have hurt as much. I don't know, maybe that's why I became a special ed teacher. He had a lot of lessons that I hold onto to this day.", "When I was young, I came home one day and I said, \"Dad, I was told men don't cry.\" He looked at me and he said, “Son, that's a lie. If you don't cry, you don't get rid of that poison that's in your body, that hurt, that pain. That's the only way you can truly be strong.\" That was one of the most powerful things that I've learned from him.

Like this story of his grandfather's death. ", "TW: He died in my arms when I was 22 years old. ", "KW: You never really talked about that, not to us. ", "TW: He got up into the morning, and he said he had a cramp in his leg. Let me try to walk it out he said. So I started following him. And then all of sudden, he just fell, his eyes rolled back in his head. So I jumped on top and tried to revive him. For the longest time, about 30 years, I had convinced myself that if I had just continued the chest compressions, he had been OK. I kept that in the back of my head that somehow I killed him. ", "It wasn't until I listened to an EMT guy. He said, \"You know, you did everything you could. It was just impossible to revive him.\" it was like a burden was pulled off my shoulders. For the first time I really, really felt good about that memory. ", "MG: There is plenty that Thompson's own father never told him either. ", "Thompson's dad was a World War Two veteran. He fought on Iwo Jima. And it wasn't until after his death that Thompson learned anything about his time at war. ", "TW: I never associated the war with him, until after he passed away when a gentleman came up to me and shook my hand and said, \"You're Milford's son.\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"He saved our butts a lot of times. At one time he ended up killing the enemy with his bare hands.\" It was really surprising to me because he never spoke of that—What he had gone through, what he had seen. For me, that was so contrary to anything I could see in my father. ", "MG: Thompson's dad was also a part of a generation of Native Americans who were taken away from their communities and sent to boarding schools where they were supposed to \"unlearn how to be Indian,\" so they could become part of white society. This was a government-sponsored program that dates back to the Civil War. Native kids were captured and sent off to these military-style academies. And the army lieutenant who founded this practice, Richard Henry Pratt, he infamously said, \"Kill the Indian. Save the child.\" Melford when to a place called the Riverside Indian School. But that re-education campaign failed with him, and he ended up reconnecting with his people, the Cado, and becoming a tribal leader. And, as it turned out, even though he didn't realize it at first, as a kid, Thompson had a huge role in his father's connection to their history.", "TW: My older brother was all-conference football player. He told me one time, he said, \"Yeah, dad used to come by and sit in the bleachers while I practice and go to all the games and watch me play.\" But when I played football, dad would drop me off, show up afterward and pick me up. He was never at the game. And that as kind of hurtful. But one day we went to a powwow. I was in a dance contest. We were right in the middle of it, and it started raining. And all the spectators took off, and I was still dancing, and I looked up. And in the rain, it was my dad. He was the only guy at the arena that was watching us. After the contest. I told him, I said, \"You got all wet.\" He goes, \"Well, yeah, it's no big deal.\" I said, \"But when I played football, you never saw any of my games.\" He said, \"Son, your brother, his world is football. Your world is going to be with our traditions and our culture.\" He said that's what he's most proud of. That's why I stick with it so much. ", "MG: Today Thompson leads powwows designed for dads, native and nonnative alike to help strengthen family ties and distill a sense of family pride. And, as he mentioned earlier, Thompson is an educator, a teacher. And we've learned so much about what he's learned from his dad, but Kiamichi-tet didn't let the interview end without telling Thompson what he's learned from him.", "KW: Everything you told me about how it's not bad showing emotion to the people you care about or your family sticks with me. I kind of feel out of place in the world I live in. What most people say is a cut-through society, I can't see it the way most people do. I want to be that person that people can go to for help because I learned that from you. You needed help at times and people weren't there for you, but you never turned someone down. ", "TW:We don't know who is watching us. That's why you have to be a role model all your life. That's why being a parent is probably the toughest job in the world because you can't be selfish. ", "Back in the olden days, I was working as a teacher's assistant. Mom didn't have a job at that time but made money by painting ornaments and things. That year we had so many bills we started got get behind. We used all our money just before Christmas. I'd been offered a job that paid me a lot more money but I wouldn't be home. I had convinced myself that this was the best thing to do because my kids needed Christmas so I took you and AuNane in the front room, sat down with you guys, and you were real quiet and AuNane looked at me and she said, \"dad, we need you more than we need presents.\" and you and AuNane both hugged me. That was a time when I as so proud because my kids knew what sacrifice was. And a week later people started buying your moms ornaments and we had plenty of money to buy you guys presents. It felt good that Christmas. It made me proud.", "KW: Thank you for teaching me so much throughout life.

Ronald actually said to us, “Once you lived in a temple, you're not really satisfied living in a tent.\"", "[MUSIC “2ND MOVEMENT\" by CRANSTON]:", "MG:Afi, Liyna, thanks for sharing this story with us and for telling a little bit more about the Clark family.", "LA: Thanks for having us.", "AYD:Thanks for having us. ", "[MUSIC OUT]:", "MG:“Once you've lived in a temple, you're not satisfied living in a tent.\" Anyone who's had to leave a beloved childhood home behind can understand Ronald's statement. And in New York City, things change so quickly and often so dramatically, that the places that mean so much to you can be replaced in the blink of an eye. The city is built on layers upon layers of memories, invisible to all but the people who have kept them fresh in their hearts and minds. ", "Nicholas Petron is one of those people, and the fashionable Chelsea neighborhood on the west side of Manhattan is one of those places.", "Today, there are fancy day spas, pricey restaurants and bars on the block where he grew up. But once there stood a building that his family called home. A building cared for and maybe even loved, by his grandfather, who came to New York City as an immigrant from Italy. ", "Nicholas Petron (NP):My maternal grandfather, Rocco Galasso, was a superintendent in an apartment building for probably 18 years of his life. And at some point he bought the building and so we grew up there. He would say to me,  ‘Nichole, we're going for a walk.'", "And I always wanted to go with grandpa. And he would get a pastrami sandwich the size of my head. And he would buy me a hotdog and he would say, “Don't you tell anybody. We just go for a good walk, right? You want another hot dog?\" And in this building, every apartment was filled with an aunt or an uncle, and every Sunday, Rocco cooked. So, all of his family would show up for dinner, all 30, 40 of us. And, one Sunday at dinner, Rocco made it clear to us that we were all going to have to move. That the city had condemned all of these buildings to build these brand new apartments. And so we had I think eight months to a year to relocate. And then one day, my mom, my dad, and my brother Michael and I, went to Rocco's apartment for the Sunday meal.", "Now, we no longer lived on the first floor, everybody else was gone, it was abandoned — except for that one apartment. We had our meal and at some point Rocco said to me and my brother, “Let's go downstairs and put some coal in the burner.\" And we got down to the coal pile and instead of grabbing the shovel he said, “Pick up as much coal as you can and put it into your pocket.\" So we stuffed our overcoat with coal and our jean pockets with coal, and we went to the backyard. And there's one light on and all of the other apartments are dark. And he takes a piece of coal out of his pocket and he throws it through one of the windows. And tears are streaming down his face. And he says, “Come on! You break the windows with me.\"", "So my brother and I just started throwing — we thought it was fun at the time — and we're smashing windows and my mom and Aunt Lucy stick their heads out going, “What are you doing, Pop? Stop it! Stop it!\" But we didn't stop till all of the windows were broken except for his apartment.", "At first my reaction was, they took his building away, that's what I thought it was about, but I realized much later that it was about the destruction of the family, which I think he knew. A month later he had to leave, and never again were we ever together on a Sunday in that way.", "[MUSIC “MILO\" by FREDRIK]:", "MG:Nicholas Petron in New York.", "[MUSIC “YEYEY\" by TIPTOE INTERNATIONAL]:", "MG:That's all for this episode.", "These stories were produced by Anita Rao, Eve Claxton, Liyna Anwar, and Vanara Taing.", "Remember to rate or review us on Apple podcasts or wherever you download the show.", "And if you want to leave a message for the people you heard in this episode..
