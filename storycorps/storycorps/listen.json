My name before that was Ray Rivera, until I started dressing in drag in 1961.", "The era before Stonewall was a hard era. There was always the gay bashings on the drag queens by heterosexual men, women, and the police.

In 1968, I was assigned as Deputy Inspector in charge of public morals in the first division in the police department, which covered the Greenwich Village area. It was the duty of Public Morals to enforce all laws concerning vice and gambling, including prostitution, narcotics, and laws and regulations concerning homosexuality.

In the era before Stonewall, all of the bars, 90% of the bars, were Mafia controlled. There wasn’t that many gay bars. You’d have maybe one, two uptown on the Upper East Side. They would get closed down. Then there’d be one or two on the west side, they’d get closed down. In midtown there’d be one, two, three, maybe open. As they would get closed down they would move around. And they were dumps.", "JOAN NESTLE:: I’m Joan Nestle, co-founder of what is now the largest collection of lesbian culture in the world. The police raided lesbian bars regularly, and they did it . . . they both did it in the most obvious way, which was hauling women away in paddy wagons. But there was regular weekend harassment, which would consist of the police coming in regularly to get their payoffs. And in the Sea Colony, we had a back room with a red light. And when that red light went on it meant the police would be arriving in around ten minutes. And so we all had to sit down at our tables, and we would be sitting there almost like school children, and the cops would come in. Now depending on who was on, which cop was on, if it was some that really resented the butch women who were with many times very beautiful women, we knew we were in for it because what would happen is they would start harassing one of these women, and saying, ”Ha, you think you’re a man? Come outside and we’ll show you.” And the woman would be dragged away. They’d throw her up against a wall and they’d say, ”So, you think you’re a man, let’s see what you got in your pants.” And they would put their hand down her pants.", "MAHONEY:: The Stonewall? Oh, that was a good bar. That was. Just to get into the Stonewall, you’d walk up and you’d knock on the front door. You’d knock and the little door would open and ”What do you want?” ”A Mary sent me.” ”Good, come on in girls.” You know. The Stonewall, like all gay bars at that time, were painted black. Charcoal black. And what was the funny part, the place would be so dimly lit — but as soon as the cops were gonna come in to collect their percentage or whatever they were coming in for, from it being a nice, dimly-lit dump, the place was lit up like Luna Park.", "PINE:: You felt, well, two guys — and that’s very often all we sent in would be two men — could handle two hundred people.

The local precinct had just received a new commanding officer, who kicked off his tenure by initiating a series of raids on gay bars. The Stonewall was an inviting target – operated by the Gambino crime family without a liquor license, the dance bar drew a crowd of drag queens, hustlers, and minors. A number of the bar’s patrons had spent the early part of the day outside the Frank Campbell Funeral Home, where Judy Garland’s funeral was held. She had died the Sunday before. It was almost precisely at midnight that the morals squad pulled up to the Stonewall Inn, led by Deputy Inspector, Seymour Pine.", "PINE:: There was never any reason to feel that anything of any unusual situation would occur that night.", "RIVERA:: You could actually feel it in the air.

As we were bringing the prisoners out, they were resisting.", "(Riot sounds in the background.)", "RIVERA:: People started gathering in front of the Sheridan Square Park right across the street from Stonewall. People were upset — ”No, we’re not going to go!” and people started screaming and hollering.", "PINE:: One drag queen, as we put her in the car, opened the door on the other side and jumped out. At which time we had to chase that person and he was caught, put back into the car, he made another attempt to get out the same door, the other door, and at that point we had to handcuff the person. From this point on, things really began to get crazy.", "BIRDY:: My name is Robert Rivera and my nickname is Birdy, and I’ve been cross-dressing all of my life. I remember the night of the riots, the police were escorting queens out of the bar and into the paddy wagon and there was this one particularly outrageously beautiful queen, with stacks and stacks of Elizabeth style, Elizabeth Taylor style hair, and she was asking them not to push her. And they continued to push her, and she turned around and she mashed the cop with her high heel. She knocked him down and then she proceeded to frisk him for the keys to the handcuffs that were on her. She got them and she undid herself and passed them to another queen that was behind her.", "PINE:: Well that’s when all hell broke loose at that point. And then we had to get back into Stonewall.", "HOWARD SMITH:: My name is Howard Smith. On the night of the Stonewall riots I was a reporter for the , locked inside with the police, covering it for my column. It really did appear that that crowd – because we could look through little peepholes in the plywood windows, we could look out and we could see that the crowd – well, my guess was within five, ten minutes it was probably several thousand people. Two thousand easy. And they were yelling ”Kill the cops! Police brutality! Let’s get ’em! We’re not going to take this anymore! Let’s get ’em!”Village Voice", "PINE:: We noticed a group of persons attempting to uproot one of the parking meters, at which they did succeed. And they then used that parking meter as a battering ram to break down the door. And they did in fact open the door — they crashed it in — and at that point was when they began throwing Molotov cocktails into the place. It was a situation that we didn’t know how we were going to be able control.", "RIVERA:: I remember someone throwing a Molotov cocktail. I don’t know who the person was, but I mean I saw that and I just said to myself in Spanish, I said. oh my God, the revolution is finally here! And I just like started screaming ”Freedom! We’re free at last!” You know. It felt really good.", "SMITH:: There were a couple of cops stationed on either side of the door with their pistols, like in combat stance, aimed in the door area. A couple of others were stationed in other places, behind like a pole, another one behind the bar. All of them with their guns ready. I don’t think up to that point I had ever seen cops that scared.", "PINE:: Remember these were pros, but everybody was frightened. There’s no question about that. I know I was frightened, and I’d been in combat situations, and there was never any time that I felt more scared than I felt that night. And, I mean, you know there was no place to run.", "RIVERA:: Once the tactical police force showed up, I think that really incited us a little bit more.", "MARTIN BOYCE:: My name is Martin Boyce and in 1969 I was a drag queen known as Miss Martin. I remember on that night when we saw the riot police, all of us drag queens, we linked arms, like the Rockettes, and sang this song we used to sing.  ”We are the Village girls, we wear our hair in curls. We wear our dungarees above our nellie knees.” And the police went crazy hearing that and they just immediately rushed us. We gave one kick and fled.(singing)", "RUDY:: My name is Rudy and the night of the Stonewall I was 18 and to tell you the truth, that night I was doing more running than fighting. I remember looking back from 10thStreet, and there on Waverly Street there was a police, I believe on his . . . a cop and he is on his stomach in his tactical uniform and his helmet and everything else, with a drag queen straddling him. She was beating the hell out of him with her shoe. Whether it was a high heel or not, I don’t know. But she was beating the hell out of him. It was hysterical.", "MAMA JEAN:: My name is Mama Jean. I’m a lesbian. I remember on that night I was in the gay bar, a woman’s bar, called Cookies. We were coming out of the gay bar going toward 8th Street, and that’s when we saw everything happening. Blasting away. People getting beat up. Police coming from every direction — hitting women as well as men with their nightsticks. Gay men running down the street with blood all over their face. We decided right then and there, whether we’re scared or not we didn’t think about, we just jumped in.", "(Song and riot sounds.)", "RIVERA:: Here this queen is going completely bananas, you know jumping on, hitting the windshield. The next thing you know, the taxicab was being turned over. The cars were being turned over, windows were shattering all over the place, fires were burning around the place. It was beautiful, it really was. It was really beautiful.", "MAMA JEAN:: I remember one cop coming at me, hitting me with the nightstick on the back of my legs. I broke loose and I went after him. I grabbed his nightstick. My girlfriend went behind him — she was a strong son of a gun. I wanted him to feel the same pain that I felt. And I kept saying to him, ”How do you like the pain? Do you like it? Do you like it?” And I kept on hitting him and hitting him. I was angry. I wanted to kill him. At that particular minute I wanted to kill him.", "RIVERA:: I wanted to do every destructive thing that I could think of at that time to hurt anyone that had hurt us through the years.", "MAMA JEAN:: It’s like just when you see a man protecting his own life. They weren’t the ”queens” that people call them, they were men fighting for their lives. And I’d fight along side them any day, no matter how old I was.", "RIVERA:: A lot of heads were bashed. But it didn’t hurt their true feelings — they all came back for more and more. Nothing — that’s when you could tell that nothing could stop us at that time or any time in the future.", "(Music: ”I’ll be loving you every time I love again . . .”)", "ISAY:: The riots were well covered in the media. The New York Daily News featured it on the front page. There were reports on all of the local television and radio stations. By the next day, graffiti calling for gay power had started to show up all over the West Village. The next night, thousands of men and women came back to the Stonewall to see what would happen next. While a couple of trashcans were set on fire and some stones were thrown, the four-hundred riot police milling around outside the bar ensured that the previous evening’s violence would not be repeated. But on this night, gay couples could be spotted walking hand in hand and kissing in the streets. Just by being at the Stonewall — surrounded by reporters, photographers, and onlookers — thousands of men and women were proclaiming that they were gay. The crowds grew and came back the next night and for one more night the following week. What happened at the Stonewall on those nights helped to usher in a new era for gay men and lesbians.", "HARWOOD:: When Stonewall happened, Bruce and I were still in the closet, where we had been for nearly forty years. But we realized that this was a tremendous thing that had happened at Stonewall and it gave us a feeling that we were not going to be remaining closeted for very much longer. And soon thereafter, we did come out of the closet.", "JINNY APPUZO:: My name is Jinny Apuzo. In 1969 I was in the convent. And when Stonewall hit the press, it hit me with a bolt of lightening. It was as if I had an incredible release of my own outrage at having to sequester so much of my life. I made my way down, I seem to recall in subsequent nights being down on the, you know, kind of just on the periphery looking. An observer — clearly an observer. Clearly longing to have that courage to come out. And as I recall it was only a matter of weeks before I left the convent and started a new life.", "HENRY BAIRD:: I am Henry Baird. In 1969 I was in the US Army, a specialist 3 stationed at Long Bend Post near Saigon, in Vietnam. I remember I was having lunch in the army mess, reading the armed forces news summary of the day, and there was a short paragraph describing a riot led by homosexuals in Greenwich Village against the police. And my heart was filled with joy. I thought about what I had read frequently, but I had no one to discuss it with. And secretly within myself I decided that when I came back stateside, if I should survive to come back stateside, I would come out as a gay person and I did.", "PINE:: For those of us in Public Morals, after the Stonewall incident things were completely changed from what they had previously been. They suddenly were not submissive anymore. They now suddenly had gained a new type of courage. And it seemed as if they didn’t care anymore about whether their identities were made known. We were now dealing with human beings.", "FAIRE:: Today I live in a senior citizen apartment building. What’s different now is that I can be free. I have a daughter who is a senior citizen and my son is 58. They know about my homosexuality. My three grandchildren in their thirties know about their grandmother.

Twenty years have passed. I’m going to be 70 in a few months. I still don’t know the answers. I would still like to know the answers. I would like to know whether I was wrong or whether I was right in ever thinking that there was a difference, in ever thinking that maybe you shouldn’t trust a homosexual because something is missing in his personality.", "NESTLE:: The archives of lesbian culture, which surrounds us now and was created four years after Stonewall, owes, at least for my part, it’s creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets. That night, in some very deep way, we finally found our place in history. Not as a dirty joke, not as a doctor’s case study, not as a freak — but as a people.", "RIVERA:: Today I’m a 38-year-old drag queen. I can keep my long hair, I can pluck my eyebrows, and I can work wherever the hell I want. And I’m not going to change for anybody.

For the past 14 years I’ve edited the prison magazine.", "While Alcatraz and Attica, Sing Sing and San Quentin are all part of the American vocabulary — you may well never have heard of Angola. But, hidden at the end of a long road in the most remote part of Louisiana, this prison has a history unlike any other. In the 1950s it was officially labeled the worst prison in the country. In the 1970s, daily inmate murders branded it the bloodiest.", "Angola doesn’t look like your typical maximum security prison — it’s a sprawling prison plantation, stretching for miles in all directions — with fields, creeks, lakes and woods. The prison is surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi River — the fourth by rattle-snake infested hills. Most of us live within the huge main prison complex — enclosed by 14 foot high fences, reinforced with endless loops of razor wire, guard towers and an army of security personnel.", "Behind these fences there’s a massive, unprecedented experiment taking place — the state is locking up large numbers of men and throwing away the keys so that age and eventually die behind bars. Traditionally most prisoners serving life sentences have had the opportunity to go free after about ten years. But in the early 1970s, Louisiana politicians came upon, what was then, a novel idea. They decided to make life sentences in Louisiana mean precisely that — they did away with the possibility of parole.", "Today there are more than 2,500 men serving this so-called ’natural-life’ sentence here at Angola. A number have now been here for some 30 years. Of those who’ve survived, most are in their 50s or 60s or 70s — the first generation of lifers to reach their twilight behind bars.", "(Sound of Moreese Bickham clipping roses.)", "MOREESE BICKHAM:: Come over here. I want to introduce you to the beautifulest rosebush on the whole yard. This one right here is my favorite. I named it after my wife, Ernestine.

So here I am, 31 years later and I’m still locked up.", "I remember when my first gray hair came in my head, I was in prison in 1960. It was right up front where I could see it good. By 1961 I had one in my mustache, by ’63 I had gray hairs all over my head. I’ve had three heart attacks since I’ve been here — the big one happened in 1977 when the pardon board turned me down.

It took me a while to figure it out, but we don’t like to see ourselves growing older each day.", "BICKHAM:: Since I been locked up, I lost all my family mostly. I can see losing my mother and father, but all my sisters, and brothers? All my aunts and uncles? God bless me now. The judge is dead, the D.A.’s dead. The lawyer’s dead. Everybody’s passed on but me.

I educated myself on death row, where I lived from the age of 19 until I was 31. Although religious literature was all we were allowed to read in a death row cell, some guards managed to smuggle books to me — I read everything I could get my hands on, and began to write.

At the desk next to mine sits associate editor Ron Wikberg, who’s serving a life sentence for a murder committed during an armed robbery. It was Ron’s in-depth study of long-termers which brought national attention to the very real possibility that Angola will soon become the nation’s largest old-folks home.", "RON WIKBERG:: The old-timers here at Angola are in a state of semi-retirement. Instead of working in the fields like they had for many years, they’ve turned in their hoes and shovels for canes, wheelchairs, crutches. They wear glasses, they wear false teeth. The prison management gives them menial assignments — cleaning doorknobs, washing windows, sweeping floors. They shuffle from place to place. They’re no longer productive, and non-productive prisoners are kind of pushed to the side. This is a place of hard labor, this is a place where prisoners are required to work. Prisoners who can’t work are kind of put to the side, and just allowed to exist.", "RIDEAU:: There are now hundreds of elderly prisoners ”existing” here at Angola. Most are housed with the general prison population — some confined to their beds, many subject to theft and harassment from younger inmates. Those just too old or sick live on the over-crowded wards of the prison hospital — stretching the Angola’s healthcare budget far past its limits.", "These long-termers have now spent more time in prison than the country’s most infamous criminals and gangsters. Many have in their own right committed very, very serious offenses. But no matter the crime, no matter whether or not they’ve changed over the decades here at Angola, there’s no way out for them.", "WIKBERG:: The long-termers were put in prison 20 and 30 years ago, they have been forgotten about in prison. And that is where the problem begins. There is no mechanism to recognize when a person becomes rehabilitated, and at that point some effort should be made to move them out of the system. It is that lack of this mechanism which has allowed the lifer population to increase 300% in just ten years here in Louisiana, and this problem is not just in Louisiana, it’s nation-wide.", "(Sound of Lifers’ Association meeting.)", "CHAIR OF LIFERS’ ASSOCIATION:: If you wouldn’t mind rising and remove the headgear — please repeat after me: ”We, the members of the Lifers’ Association of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana, join together for the improvement of ourselves and society.” (addressing meeting)", "(Crowd repeats.)", "”We have love in our hearts, for all men.

I’ve been incarcerated for murder here in Angola since 1961.", "I’ve been here so long it’s difficult to imagine how it feels to be free.

Except for the television, we wouldn’t know that there’s a world out there; except for the radios, we wouldn’t know. We actually come here, and when we come here everything stops. This, this is a graveyard. A graveyard of time.", "PATTERSON:: I feel like my life have been frozen in time. Like the Cosby show. I look at those kind of shows and I wonder sometime, ”Is it fiction? Is it really real?” You know, because I can only relate to that which I came out of in ’61, and when I came here in ’61, the restaurants were segregated. When I caught a bus, I caught the back end of the bus, I had to go to the back, I couldn’t sit in the front. You look at the changes from that time that you stopped, and they say, ”Well, they doing this today, they doing that,” and you wonder, ”Is it real? That’s for real there man?”", "WHITE:: The living dead, that’s an accurate description of it, because the things that it takes to live, to feel life, we not in contact with that. We fantasize. That’s all we have left is our fantasies and our dreams, and this is what a lot of people rely on to make it.", "GREEN:: I often picture my son in my mind’s eye. The last time I saw him he was ten years old, and now he’s 35. I often imagine the scene of when James and I face each other the first time. What will I do? Will we move towards each other? Will I be able to hug him? What response will I get from that hug? Will it be — will it be a loving hug? This picture runs over and over in my mind. It’s like a dream that occurs over and over and over.", "WHITE:: It’s as if you don’t exist, it’s like you in a spirit and everything around you is alive, and you can’t touch, you can’t reach, you can’t do anything but just look. We can’t touch people lives, we can’t touch their lives. That’s what tears us up, we can’t touch their lives.", "(White begins to sob.)", "RIDEAU:: Recently some disturbing things have begun to happen here, even by Angola’s standards.", "It started a year ago, with a long-term inmate named Francis Clifton. After serving 27 years of a life sentence for murder at Angola, Clifton had a most comfortable prison job. He was moved outside the razor-wire fences of the main prison complex, in a house here at the ’Pens, where he tended Angola’s blood hounds and attack dogs. At 52, he could have served the rest of his sentence free of chains and guards. But last April, Clifton ran. For five days he hid in the hills, evading the blood hounds which he, better than anyone, knew would eventually catch up with him. On the fifth day, exhausted, Clifton walked out of the hills, flagged down a car and turned himself in.", "FRANCIS CLIFTON:: When you finally realize you’re going to die here, it just starts working on your mind. It’s a terrible feeling just know you’re going to stay here till you die.", "RIDEAU:: Clifton has spent the year since his capture in solitary confinement.", "CLIFTON:: In spite of all the other fears and problems out there, and the worries on my mind, the guards running all over the place with guns chasing me, and knowing I could be shot at any time, I still was able to enjoy that little bit of freedom, after 28 years. . . Eh, well.. . .", "RIDEAU:: A few weeks later, it happened again. Long-term inmate Donald Fink was being marched into the fields for a day’s work. Suddenly, he turned and began to walk away. ”I’m going home,” he said, and as he started to run, the guards lifted their guns, aimed and fired.", "Things got worse from there. Angola erupted in an unprecedented epidemic of attempted escapes, suicides and killings. Many involved old-timers, traditionally the most stable inmates at the prison. By mid-summer 1989, a federal judge was forced to declare a ”State of Emergency” here. That order is still in effect today — and the desperate acts continue . . . as hopelessness creeps through the tiers and cell blocks of Angola.", "HILTON BUTLER:: To me, I think life without the possibility of pardon or parole — if you know you have no hope for pardon or parole — would be worse than the death sentence. If you know you’re gonna die at Angola. . .", "RIDEAU:: Hilton Butler was warden here until the state of emergency was declared last August. Butler had worked at Angola for forty years, but when things started getting out of hand, he was fired.", "BUTLER:: I’m no softy — I gave the signal for the switch to be pulled eleven times when I was warden, but I feel that what’s going on at Angola now is wrong. You have to give an inmate hope. When he’s lost hope, he’s lost everything.", "RIDEAU:: In today’s political climate the last hope for lifers — a pardon from the governor — has all but disappeared. A year ago, Louisiana’s Governor Buddy Roemer let Christmas pass without granting a single clemency — it was the first time that this had happened in the state’s history. Here, prisoners finally began to comprehend the grim reality of natural life sentences. For many — particularly the older men — the fragile illusion of eventual freedom crumbled.", "BUFFETT:: Since I was convicted of rape 28 years ago, I’ve had a recommendation from the pardon board six times to go, even the victim have asked for my release, but yet the governor still refuse to let me go. So it seem that, you know we gonna die here.", "BICKHAM:: ”Point Lookout” — we sometimes call it ”Boot Hill,” is a place where they bury the dead. Old timers think about it a right good deal but they don’t talk about it much, because they ’fraid that they might get buried out there. See if you buried out there, you really forgotten. ’Cause nobody comes here to see you — nobody even passes by boot hill.", "PATTERSON:: When you die at Angola, you don’t die as ”Henry Patterson lies here.” You die as ”554915 is in the ground up there.” I don’t want to die a number, I don’t want to die an insignificant number. A prison number — nah.", "GREEN:: I don’t want to die here and be forgotten. I don’t want to spend my last moment on earth here in penitentiary. I would like to see the outside once more. We’re trying to hold onto a little faith, but it’s constantly deteriorating.", "WHITE:: When you start to realize that you’re never going to leave this place, hopelessness begins to take hold of your time. It’s like a disease — everybody around you have it, and it’s just a matter of time until you’ll be next. That’s the torture.

They spend the vast majority of their time in one of two rooms on the ward: the smoking room or the day room. The day room is the larger and more cheerful of the rooms. Posters of raccoons and bears and cats hang on the walls. Patients sleep or watch TV, talk to themselves or each other. At the center of the room, Alfonse, a heavyset old Italian man in a tattered cap sits with a world almanac and a pad, meticulously writing out the names of the countries in the European Economic Community, over and over again. Another older man, Nicholas, who is Greek, paces the room, scratching his gray beard talking endlessly, to anyone who will listen, about the evils of taking prayer out of the schools.", "NICHOLAS:: They shouldn’t throw the prayer of the school away.

One of these is violence. The state considers the staffers who work on the ward to hold the single most dangerous job in New York, with the highest injury rate of any profession. The other constant on the ward is noise. There is nowhere to escape it, although there is one patient who seems to have adapted to it quite well. His name is Peter, and you can always find him at the front of the dayroom, hunched over a table peacefully drawing with yellow plugs stuffed deep into his ears.

And if I didn’t do what was expected for me to do, that assassin would come through the door and kill me. That was the imaginary fear that I acted upon.", "ISAY:: Peter slashed his girlfriend’s throat with a razor blade. She lived, he tells me, and has since married and had children. They are still friends. He says that the recovery from his mental illness has been long and difficult — torturous at times. It’s only over the past year or so that he’s begun to feel ’well’ again.

When I saw that picture I was wondering how the director got that shot, because that’s how I felt. I just felt like a set of eyes. I felt like the person that is me, the real me, was pushed back and was just an observer. I was more like witness of things that was happening. It was like watching a movie from inside my body. And when I saw that picture I says ’O boy,’ I don’t see how this director got this shot, because that’s how I felt — only like I was a set of eyes. The rest of me was like . . . gone.Halloween", "ISAY:: Alfred says he has a difficult time feeling any remorse for the murders he committed. He spends his days on the ward exercising or meditating or doing yoga, wearing a sweat-suit with the hood pulled over his head. There’s something about Alfred’s face when he speaks. His mouth moves but everything else remains completely still. He is the only patient I meet who strikes me as . . . spooky . . . the way I had originally imagined the patients might be. He is also the only patient who says he objects to these sorts of stereotypes about the criminally insane.", "RUMPEL:: It’s just like sitting in here with you by yourself.

About 80% of the patients here were victims of very serious physical or sexual abuse as children. Like Jan, who owns the guitar which his friend Floyd is now playing. Jan is an extremely quiet, dazed-looking 26 year-old Polish émigré who always dresses in black. Throughout his childhood, Jan’s father beat and tortured him.", "JAN:: Sometimes he’d come over to me and he’d, like when I was sleeping he’d wake me by taking me by the hair and banging my head against the wall.

He later told me not to take his frightening facial expressions personally. They were due, he said, to the drugs he was on. I had also heard from some staff members about Mohammed’s childhood. With some degree of regularity, his parents would cook the family’s pets, and then force Mohammed to eat them.", "At dinner on my last evening on Ward 2-West I had mentioned to Mohammed that I was Jewish.

Dad said, ”You’re going to city hall and going to be part of all this excitement, what about me?” I said, ”Dad I’m sending a limo to pick you up.” My dad had never been in a limo. He got a new suit, came down… and the limo took him down and he…he was in the front row when we walked down the isle. Both his arms were in the air. He was 89 at that point. And he didn’t see it just for gay people, he saw it for, you know, all people that had been discriminated against. And, his whole life he had been discriminated against. So, I think, for Dad, it was just a victory that he could be a part of. He could not have been more proud. It was a great day."]}

She folded the walls. She folded the roof. She folded the doors that opened so horses could go in and out. It was like magic. I looked at it. There was no tape. She had just, sort of like origami or something folded a barn. I had no idea where she learned to do that, how she knew how to do it.

At the height of its popularity WEVD landed accounts from brand-name sponsors like Manischewitz, Hebrew National, and Campbell’s Soup. But smaller stations like Brooklyn’s WLTH and WBBC were perpetually having to go into the community to rustle up business from mom-and-pop stores on the Lower East Side and along Pitkin Avenue in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.Much to their listeners’ dismay, these stations often filled as much as 50 percent of the broadcast day with pitches. Often inspired, occasionally insipid, commercials from neighborhood stores were the lifeblood of Yiddish radio.To the ethnographer, these shards provide a vivid snapshot of what ordinary people wore, ate, drank, and cleaned their houses with. For the rest of us, they’re simply some of the most memorable ads ever created — from the Joe and Paul clothiers jingle to the language-murdering ad copy of Mitchell Levitsky, WEVD’s advertising king.Few figures from the golden age of Yiddish radio are more widely if anonymously recalled than Mitchell Levitsky. He began his radio career in 1927, at age 18, as a Yiddish announcer for New York’s WFAB. But by the time he arrived at WEVD in 1943, he had discovered his true calling: selling radio ads.As the patriarch of advertising sales reps, Levitsky proved an unstoppable force on the streets of the Lower East Side, tossing shop after shop into his game sack. Dick Sugar, the veteran WEVD announcer, recalls that shop owners along Second Avenue would push Levitsky out the front door only to turn around and see him coming through the back. Yet one way or another, Levitsky always got his man. Portnoy’s Trusses, Mrs. Weinberg’s Frozen Kosher Chopped Liver, Meyer Mehadrin Kosher Herring Products — one and all fell before Levitsky’s relentless onslaught.Shopkeeper’s buying ads from Levitsky hired not just WEVD airtime but the on-air talents of the advertising king, whose delivery was legendary among Jewish New Yorkers. When Levitsky spoke English it sounded like Yiddish was his first language, and when he spoke Yiddish you would swear he was born here. He wended his way through ad copy as though navigating a minefield, stopping to rest on “ums” and “ahs” and regrouping during significant pauses that lapsed into dead air. Yet despite such caution, WEVD listeners heard pitches for bedroom “suits” and hotel rooms with “wall-to-wall telephones in every room.”Levitsky wooed advertisers by impressing upon them that one little commercial would make them big-time theatrical producers. Each pint-size patron of the arts also got an annual cruise of the East River complete with an open bar and celebrity shipmates like Jewish boxing great Benny Leonard. By the by, Levitsky would corner his guests to discuss a renewal of their contract.In addition to hawking ads, Levitsky hosted knockoff shows like the advice program  and a Sunday morning children’s hour. He was the announcer for , featuring the Joseph Rumshinsky Orchestra. And he was the host of the long-running , on which he read offbeat items gleaned from the week’s papers. Listeners to these programs recall no dearth of commercial messages. The Jewish Court of Human Relations.Paul Kofsky opened his first clothing store in Brooklyn in 1912. He called it Joe and Paul – inventing an imaginary cohort, Joe, because he thought people would trust him more if they thought he had a partner. By the early ’30s, Kofsky, a dapper man with a penchant for paper neckties, held sway over a successful chain, with new locations in Manhattan and the Bronx. Sartorial success aside, Kofsky had a greater ambition: to rub shoulders with the Yiddish stars of the day.He made his dream come true in 1936 by walking into WLTH’s studio and hiring the station’s musical director, Yiddish theater composer Sholom Secunda, to write a song advertising his store. As for the singing, Kofsky would handle that himself.For the next decade, Kofsky spent most of his days shuttling between stations to perform his jingle live on the air and to talk theater shop with his fellow performers. The ad became more than ubiquitous; to many listeners, “Joe and Paul” was Yiddish radio.So it happened that a young comedian named Aaron Chwatt (who later became Red Buttons) used “Joe and Paul” as the basis for an extended Borscht Belt parody of Yiddish radio. His routine centered on the fictitious station WBVD, whose programming consisted of commercials interrupted by more commercials, each sillier than the last. For listeners of Yiddish radio, the send-up hit home.Called to service in World War Two, Red Buttons left the hugely successful skit in the Catskills, where the Barton Brothers comedy team picked it up from hotel staff who had learned it by heart. The Bartons recorded the bit in 1947 for the fledgling Apollo label and soon found themselves proud progenitors of the biggest Yiddish party record ever. According to Eddie Barton, three-quarters of a million records were sold in a span of a few months. The song was so popular it spawned a Latin cover arranged by Tito Puente.Ironically, most people who bought the Barton Brothers’ 78 rpm never heard the original “Joe and Paul” jingle, which had always been confined to the range of New York City radio waves. Kofsky, it can be assumed, did not mind the additional exposure.The Yiddish Radio Project"]}

As the thing got bigger, I tried to stand up and I couldn’t see my feet. The directions said it would go to 48 if I wanted it to. I thought what would happen if it goes beyond 48.

Well it’s difficult to explain to people in English that part of your anatomy just blew up, but to try to do it in Spanish it’s beyond hope. So they made a landing. I was taken off the plane and turned over to two women police. And they told me to strip, hunting for what they thought was the bomb.

Aeby was a 21-year-old amateur photographer. He was working as a technician on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, when he was granted permission to photograph a top-secret test, code named Trinity.Germany invades Poland: beginning of WWII.The U.S. begins its effort to develop a nuclear weapon. This is code-named the “Manhattan Project,” and Colonel Leslie Groves is put in charge.Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor.U.S. enters WWII.Los Alamos, New Mexico selected as bomb development site, and J. Robert Oppenheimer is made director. Listen to newsreel [MP3, 506 KB].Japan becomes the primary target for any future atomic bomb, according to the Military Policy Committee of the Manhattan Project.Nazi Germany surrenders to the Allies.The first atomic bomb is exploded at 5:29 AM Mountain War Time in the New Mexico desert. This is known as the “Trinity Test.” Listen to newsreel [MP3, 506 KB].President Truman authorizes use of atomic bombs.The U.S., Great Britain, and China issue the Potsdam Declaration, calling for the complete surrender of Japan. Listen to newsreel [MP3, 300 KB].The atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy,” is dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.A second atomic bomb, nicknamed “Fat Man,” is dropped on Nagasaki, Japan.Japan surrenders.We were terribly devoted to the project. We were convinced that it could be done. We had done lots of experiments in the experimental nuclear division showing that fission occurs immediately. We had done a lot of experiments on the implosion, which looked all right, but if it had not worked we would have tried again and we certainly would have kept at it, and we certainly would have dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.I think everybody, after the test, felt he had made history and we were aware this would [be] world history from now on. We felt very accomplished. We felt we had done our job and we went on waiting for the actual drop on Japan.I believed then and believe even more today, that the use of the atomic bomb, in that particular case was not only justified, but necessary. On the other hand ten years later it was totally different. Both the United States and the Soviet Union had hundreds, and then thousands of nuclear weapons, and so if a war had broken out between these two superpowers nuclear weapons would have been used from the beginning. They would not have been used to finish a war, but to start a war. And that makes all the difference.It was a cool desert morning, the sun had not quite come up, the air was still, it had that curious chill of a hot place, which is the coolest hour of the day. And suddenly on that cold background the heat of the sun came to me before the sun rose. It was the heat of the bombnot the lightbut the heat was the first thing that I could feel: as though the sun had suddenly risen. But that was an unforgettable experience, because what you feel, I think, is deeper in the memory than what you just see. And so the notion that it wassome way, in the most elementary human way, competitive with the full sun, that was the time I got the sense of the power of the bomb more than anything else. It was unforgettable.I think it opened the door to a dreadful corridor down which we never finally went, despite being very close to it. I always felt one small nuclear war was all that anyone could tolerate. We can’t have a second one. I think the main thing I want to say is it has to stop, and its not stopping yet.For minus 30-seconds on we heard nothing. That was an eternity and I was sure that there has been a failure. Then there appeared a very small point of light, and my first impression was, I very distinctly remember, Is that all? I started to see the point rising and spreading[and] by that time I knew it was big. Then I was impressed. We knew that in a short time this would be used and it would be the real thing.The bomb was dropped, and we saw the effects. I at once had a strong feeling of regret. Even today, I believe had we dropped the first bomb at an altitude of 30-thousand feet over Tokyo Bay that 10-million Japanese would have seen it and heard the thunderclash, including the emperor; probably it would have ended the war without a single person being hurt. And had that happened, we today would not be afraid of radioactivity. We today, would be much more reasonable about the simple fact that we ought to have the strengths, but we ought to be very careful before using it."]}

And so he said maybe theres some on the other side, lets go ahead and cross. Now we had never walked on the trestle and we really knew better but uh, the train had already pulled out of the station, so we felt secure, you know, in doing that. And we started walking across the trestle, and suddenly we could feel the tracks shaking, and we heard the train whistle, and way behind us was an express train that was coming through, and we didn’t know about it.

And I got down and I tried to pull the little boys foot out, and I lifted him up until he cried because his leg hurt, and I realized, my goodness, this is desperate. And, Suddenly, it occurred to me to unlace his shoe! And so I looked down, and there was just one end of the shoelace was showing. And I pulled on it, and miraculously, the bow came apart. And they were high-top shoes with real stiff soles. And I took my index finger and I scrubbed at the shoelaces and loosened them and pulled his foot out and grabbed him up and took him in my arms, and I ran off the trestle, and we got down the side of the hill. And just as the train went across, the steam from the engine showered us. And uh We were Boy.

When I started going to church I met American missionary: Bob and ? Pingston. They’re you know, not young couple. They about 60’s at the time. Of course they are now both of them in heaven. And when they start English bible class at their house as we sit there at the living room we watch, learning, observing their life together. And they’re always the ‘honey I love you’ and ‘honey thank you’ you know ‘i’m sorry’ and she started washing dishes the husband is standing beside her and you know dry and they ‘wow they so happy. always smiling. oh how wonderful. l how happy they are.’ And then when I look you know my mother, she served husband, my dad, like a king. And then you know cook, so hard and then you know, I never heard dad say thank you or I love you. Never heard that. So I decide when I get married I want to be happy sweet couple like missionary friend. Of course when I get married it’s typical Korean man when I said ‘honey I love you’ and the typical man just sitting in the living room reading newspaper didn’t respond so I said ‘I love you’ and he said ‘ok’ and I wasn’t satisfied with that answer. Because love you know expression. So. I said ‘I love you’ oh ‘me too’. ‘Well can’t you say I love you too?’ At first he said it’s very hard. He said he’s not used to express. You know. I said ‘I love you’ until he respond ‘honey I love you too’ and an ongoing practice and later on it wasn’t difficult he just say ‘I love you too’ and then hug and even kiss on my cheek so that was started from the beginning. Very sweet expression of love, appreciation, happy happy family and which now we have… I see you approve, right?", "JKL: Yes I love it."]}

She was taking life saving so she could be our lifeguard when we had a swimming pond built. She had to take a written exam and I would be reading the questions at the back of the chapter, and she had it memorized – she had it down by rote and so…. The question I asked her was: What do you do when you’re swimming in a pond and underwater weeds start to pull you under? She just answered, Boom: “Extricate yourself with slow undulating motions.” I didn’t even really know what it meant. I just knew it was the funniest thing I’d ever heard. And I found that when I got into that state with my mother that was when we weren’t mother and daughter anymore. Those roles just sort of fell by the wayside and in that moment we were just two people laughing.", "CN: I know she’s only been gone a short time, but what do you miss most about your mom?", "KH: She would sit while she watched us swimming in the pond with her knees in front of her and her arms resting on her knees, and her back was so tan. She had this kind of Mediterranean skin that would go that bronze, rich color. And I just want to put my cheek next to it. It’s a very animal type of longing but… Uh…. One of the last things she said to me. I was leaving and as every time I left in the last year or two I’d always say “Well mom, we’re not sure we’ll get to see each other again.” And so I was ready to walk out and catch my shuttle to the airport and she said, “Well Kristi, it’s been really nice knowing you.” And it was so sweet. It was just the sweetest thing."]}

Instead of just buying pork chops for his family he would buy a whole pig. And then we’d go up to the rooftop and roast that pig.

Once every man wore a hat, in the ashen newsreels, the avenues of cities are broad rivers flowing with hats. The ballpark swelled with thousands of straw hats, brims and bands, rows of men, smoking and cheering in shirtsleeves. Hats were the law, they went without saying. You noticed a man in a crowd without a hat. You bought them from Adams or Dobbs who branded your initials in gold on the inside band. Trollies crisscrossed the city, steamships sailed in and out of the harbor, men with hats gathered on the docks. There was a person to block your hat and a hat-check girl to mind it while you had a drink or ate a steak with peas and a baked potato. In your office, stood a hat rack. The day war was declared, everyone was wearing a hat, and they were wearing hats when a ship, loaded with men and women sank in the icy sea. My father wore one to work everyday and returned home carrying the evening paper, the winter chill radiating from his overcoat. But today we go bare-headed into the winter streets, stand hatless on frozen platforms. Today the mailboxes on the roadside, and the spruce trees behind the house wear cold, white hats of snow. Mice scurry from the stone walls at night in their thin fur hats to eat the birdseed that has spilled. And now my father, after a life of work wears a hat of earth, and on top of that hat, a lighter one, of cloud and sky, a hat of wind."]}

That’s another part of life in these old hotels. See, up here in the Sunshine we’re totally isolated from the rest of the world, so we create our own little society. Anything you want you can get from another tenant. We have a loan shark, a drug dealer, a guy who does other tenant’s laundry for a couple of bucks, a room cleaner.

Really rough living.", "(Sounds of guitar strumming.)", "SMITH:: Some historical facts about this joint: The Sunshine was opened in 1922 by a guy named Frank Mazarra. Cubicles were a dime a night.

Now they’re looking to sell.", "BUCKALOO:: They should make this building landmark status.", "SMITH:: Yeah, that’s an idea.", "MASSA:: Yeah, sure is.

This place is the Last of the Mohicans.", "SMITH:: Like all of the flops, The Sunshine is a ’men’s only’ establishment. Some of the hotels left on the Bowery are still ’whites only,’ but I let everyone in here. All races, all ages, all kinds of stories. We all have one thing in common: we’re on our own. We all had homes, but for some reason we left, or got thrown out. Take me for example. Used to work in a bank, until one day, many years ago, I was injured on the job.

I was on the old impossible quest for ”truth.” You know? Ahh . . . it’s like singing from that song ”What’s it all about, Alfie?” Who hasn’t wondered what it’s all about. Some fierce ambitions along those lines. I don’t know. Seemed like I was making some progress. It was intoxicating. And after a while, it seemed like some crazy pipe dream, as they say. You know, figure there’ve been a lot more substantial heavyweights than me, by far, through history, and they didn’t seem to come up with the answers. The big answers.

Lit with candles. There are piles of books on the floor, and posters on his wall.", "MAX:: There’s a painting of Durer’s Saint Jerome, who was a hermit. He went to the desert and lived by himself for a very long time to try to seek knowledge. And achieve illumination. In a sense that’s what I’m doing too, I guess. It’s um, grotesque, and I enjoy it.

And that means his room is available for anybody that wants to rent. He’s just a clean-out now. Nothing personal. He’s a clean-out, and I’m gonna clean him out and sell his room. Maybe tomorrow. I’ll probably sell it tomorrow, more than likely.", "SMITH:: Sign here, my friend. Sign and print.", "SMITH:: One tenant leaves, another checks in, but the hotel never really changes. The Sunshine will always be a dark place. Wake up every morning with chicken-wire just above you. Walls hemming you in on all sides. Alone. It’s a stunningly sad place to live. Sometimes at the Sunshine I close my eyes and drift off. I forget where I am for just a second or two. Suddenly I’m not in a flop hotel, but sitting in some family kitchen, drinking a cup of coffee. Then I wake up and I’m back at the hotel. Just like everyone else here, hoping for a break.

Since 1924 all executions in Texas have taken place right here. We’ve carried out a lot of executions here lately, and with all the debate about the death penalty I thought this might be a good time to let you hear exactly how we do these things. Sometimes I wonder whether people really understand what goes on down here and the effect it has on us.", "The death house sits in a corner of the prison. It’s a small brick building with eight cells and a death chamber. Most days it’s empty and quiet. Death Row is actually located about forty miles east of the Walls. But on execution day the condemned prisoner is transported here.", "The inmate arrives at the death house early in the afternoon on the day of his execution and gets placed in a cell. He spends the afternoon with the death house chaplain . . . waiting. At 2:00 he’s allowed a phone call, at 3:00 a visit with his attorney and his spiritual advisor, at 4:30 he’s given his last meal.", "But I’m gonna start our story where the execution process really begins. At five minutes to six, I’m sitting in my office. I get up from my chair, put on my jacket, and walk back to the death house. At this time the inmate is in his cell, talking with the prison’s chaplain, Jim Brazzil.", "BRAZZIL:: I’ve had ’em where they wanted to sing. I had one offender tell lawyer jokes. That was his time during that five minutes right before he was executed — wanted to tell lawyer jokes. And I’ve had ’em want to do exercises, do calisthenics sitting in there, you know, because it’s such a nervous time. Because at that time reality has truly set in that in a few moments he’s going to be dead.", "WILLETT:: One of my supervisors will get a call at 6:00 from the governor’s office, and one from the attorney general’s office, telling us that it’s okay to go ahead with this execution. The inmate’ll be in the second cell and I usually go down there and I call his name and tell him it’s time to come with me to the next room.", "BRAZZIL:: He’ll walk up to the cell where we are and he’ll say ’It’s time.’ And so they will unlock the cell and he’s not handcuffed or chained. He’s just sitting there. And he and I will walk into the chamber.", "WILLETT:: When he gets into the chamber, I’ll tell him to sit down on the gurney and then lay down with his head on pillow. At that time when he gets in there, all of the straps are undone. And within probably thirty, forty-five seconds the officers have him completely strapped in.", "DEAN:: My name is Kenneth Dean and I’ve participated in approximately over a hundred executions as a member of the tie down team. Each supervisor is assigned a different portion — like we have a head person, a right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg. And the right leg man will tell him ’I need you to hop up onto the gurney. Lay your head on this end, put your feet on this end.’ Simultaneously while he’s laying down the straps are being put across him.", "GREEN:: I’m Captain Terry Green. I’m a member of the tie down team in the execution process. What I do, I will strap the offender’s left wrist.

Some of them are upset. Some of them are crying.", "GREEN:: Some of them have been sweating. Some of them will have the smell of anxiety, if you will. Of fear.", "DEAN:: Usually within about twenty seconds he’s completely strapped down. Twenty to thirty seconds. I mean, it’s down to a fine art.", "GREEN:: It’s basically a situation where we just make sure he is secure. That he won’t be jumping up, that he won’t be able to squirm out of the restraints themselves, and that the job can be done — the job being the execution itself.", "DEAN:: After all the straps are done they will look at you and they’ll say ’Thank you.’ And here you’ve just strapped them into the table. And they look at you in the eye and tell you ’Thank you for everything that you’ve done.’ And, you know, that’s kind of a weird feeling.", "(Music fades in.)", "DEAN:: It’s kind of hard to explain what you actually feel, you know, when you talk to a man and you kind of get to know that person, and then you walk him out of a cell and you take him in there to the chamber and tie him down.

And so I am one of the few people in the state that is able to play a part in the process.", "DEAN:: It’s a very unique job. Very unique. Not many people are willing to do this or can do this. I . . . I do believe in what I do. If I didn’t and I felt that it was morally wrong or ethically wrong, then I wouldn’t participate in it. And that’s something we are not required to do — is participate in it. But I do this voluntarily.", "GREEN:: One thing I am glad of is that we’re not using electric chair. I don’t think I would want to be part of that. This process here, it’s clinical. The inmate, other than the fact that he’s expired, you don’t know anything has happened to him. And, you know, that’s good.", "DEAN:: You know, it’s something that everybody has to deal with it in their own way. You know, some people they might like to drink and forget about it.

It never crossed my mind that some of these people are just like the rest of us and are scared to death of a needle. Usually, if it goes right, and normally it does, usually in about three minutes they’ve got this guy hooked up to the lines. And at that time the inmate’s lying on the gurney and myself and Chaplain Brazzil are in the execution chamber with the inmate.", "BRAZZIL:: I usually put my hand on their leg right below their knee, you know, and I usually give ’em a squeeze, let ’em know I’m right there. You can feel the trembling, the fear that’s there, the anxiety that’s there. You can feel the heart surging, you know. You can see it pounding through their shirt.", "WILLETT:: I’ve seen them so nervous they get one of these twitches in their leg or something and can’t stop it. And I’ve seen the opposite. I’ve seen people lay up there, hooked up and waiting for the witnesses to come in. I believe I could say they were more calm than I am with you right now.", "WILLETT:: At 6:09 my staff escorts the witnesses into two small rooms adjacent to the death chamber. They push up real close to the windows to get a view. Larry Fitzgerald is our public relations officer. He’s witnessed about 120 executions.", "FITZGERALD:: Once the IVs are established, then we bring the witnesses in, and in Texas the inmate is allowed five witnesses plus a spiritual advisor. The victims are allowed five witnesses. Plus there are five media witnesses.", "SORGE:: I’m Wayne Sorge, news director of KSAM in Huntsville, Texas. Well when we’re brought into the room, the inmate is already strapped to the gurney and the tubes are inserted in each wrist.", "GIDEON:: My name is Leighanne Gideon. I am a former reporter for the .

With huge silver buckles.Huntsville Item", "GRACZYK:: I’m Michael Graczyk from the Associated Press. When they’re on the gurney they’re stretched out. His arms are extended.

The warden will stand at the head of the condemned man and the chaplain will generally be standing with his hand on the condemned person’s knee. The warden will ask if the condemned man has any last words he’d like to say. A boom mike will come down from the ceiling and sometimes you can see the man who’s strapped in with probably eight to ten straps across his body — he’ll struggle to get his voice close to the mike. It’s not necessary, but he does it anyway.Fort Worth Star Telegram", "GRACZYK:: And the inmate either declines to speak or says nothing or says a lot or sings or prays or does any number of things.", "MORITZ:: Generally the voice is emotional, nervous, cracks a little bit.", "GIDEON:: A lot of inmates apologize. A lot of inmates will say that you’re executing an innocent man. And then there have been some men who have been executed that I knew, and I’ve had them tell me goodbye.", "WILLETT:: I will have talked to him at least once and somewhere in there found out how I’m gonna know when he’s through with his statement. And most of them will tell me ’This will be my last line.’ Or some of them just say ’Warden, I’ll tell you,’ and they will literally just turn to me and say ’Warden that’s all.’", "MORITZ:: The warden will remove his glasses, which is the signal to the executioners behind a mirrored glass window. And when the glasses come off, the lethal injection begins to flow.", "(Music fades in.)", "GIDEON:: I was twenty-six years old when I witnessed my first execution. After the execution was over, I felt numb. And that’s a good way to explain it. And a lot of people will tell you that, that it’s just a very numb feeling afterwards.", "MORITZ:: The first execution I did, I was wondering how I’d react to it. But it’s like any other unpleasant situation a reporter is asked to cover. At some point there’s a detachment. You realize that it’s not about you; it’s about the guy who’s about ready to be put to death.", "GIDEON:: I’ve walked out of death chamber numb and my legs feeling like rubber sometimes, my head maybe not really feeling like it’s attached to my shoulders. I’ve been told that it’s perfectly normal, everyone feels it, and that after a while that numb feeling goes away. And indeed it does.", "SORGE:: I wrestle with myself about the fact that it’s easier now, and was I right to make part of my income from watching people die? And I have to recognize the fact that what I do for a living is hold up a mirror to people of what their world is. Capital punishment is part of that, and if you are in the city where more capital punishment occurs than any place else in the civilized world, that’s got to be part of the job.", "(Music ends.)", "WILLETT:: At 6:12 the executioner — a member of my staff whose identity is kept secret — begins to administer the chemicals. This is public relations officer Larry Fitzgerald again.", "FITZGERALD:: Texas doesn’t use a machine. Some states use an actual injection machine. We use a syringe that is administered through an IV tube from another room.", "BRAZZIL:: This is Chaplain Brazzil again. The first chemical that’s used is a drug called sodium pentathol, okay, and sodium pentathol is the same chemical that they use on you whenever you are going to have surgery, and it works very quick.", "WILLETT:: I know that at times they know when it’s happening to ’em. One in particular I can remember, he said ’I can taste it.’", "BRAZZIL:: Had one man who wanted to sing ”Silent Night.” He made his final statement and then after the warden gave the signal he started singing ”Silent Night,” and he got to the point ’Round yon virgin mother and child’ and just as he got ’child’ out was the last word.", "MORITZ:: The people inside the room watching it are invariably silent. Sometimes you find people holding hands, maybe a mother and father of a murder victim or friends of the condemned man.", "GIDEON:: It’s very quiet. It’s extremely quiet. You can hear every breath everyone takes around you. You can hear the cries, the weeping, the praying.", "FITZGERALD:: The second chemical is pancuronium bromide, which is a muscle relaxant. It causes the diaphragm and the lungs to collapse.", "WILLETT:: It’s usually a real . . . real deep breath. Just seems like they draw in all the air they can.", "GIDEON:: And then whenever that breath goes, it’s like a snore. I mean it’s like  — kind of like taking a balloon and squishing that balloon and the sound that a balloon makes when you’re squishing the air out of it.(makes sound)", "MORITZ:: Generally there is some erratic movement on the part of the inmate, some coughing, sputtering, occasionally a gasp. Then there’s quiet.", "BRAZZIL:: I’ve had several of them where watching their last breath go from their bodies and their eyes never unfix from mine. I mean actually lock together. And I can close my eyes now and see those eyes. My feelings and my emotions are extremely intense at that time. I’ve never . . . I’ve never really been able to describe it. And I guess in a way I’m kind of afraid to describe it. I’ve never really delved into that part of my feelings yet.", "FITZGERALD:: The third chemical actually stops the heart.", "WILLETT:: At that point, and it’s just something out of tradition — and I certainly haven’t messed with it because it’s worked — I was told to wait three minutes from that point and I have kept it to a tee, three minutes.", "GIDEON:: You see no more breathing, you hear no more sounds. It’s just waiting.", "GRACZYK:: I had a mother collapse right in front of me. We were standing virtually shoulder to shoulder. She collapsed, hit the floor, went into hyperventilation, almost convulsions.", "GIDEON:: I’ve seen family members collapse in there. I’ve seen them scream and wail. I’ve seen them beat the glass.", "SORGE:: I’ve seen them fall into the floor, totally lose control. And yet how do you tell a mother that she can’t be there in the last moments of her son’s life?", "GIDEON:: You’ll never hear another sound like a mother wailing whenever she is watching her son be executed. There’s no other sound like it. It is just this horrendous wail. You can’t get away from it. That wail surrounds the room. It’s definitely something you won’t ever forget.", "(Music fades in.)", "PICKETT:: My name is Reverend Carroll Pickett. I’m a Presbyterian minister. I’m retired from the Walls Unit where I was chaplain for the death house. And I walked with and stood by and witnessed the execution of ninety-five inmates, from the first one that was done in 1982 until the end of August, 1995.", "In the beginning days of executions in Texas we were faced with something that nobody had ever done before. Nobody had ever been executed by lethal injection. It was a brand new concept of humane execution. And we were to do the very first one. It was a new — almost a new world. In the beginning everybody was a name, but as it got on they just started doing it . You do three a year is one thing. You do thirty-five a year, that’s a lot.bam bam bam", "I’ve had guards — lots of guards quit. Even those tough guards you talk about. A lot of those quit. Some of them couldn’t take it. Some of them couldn’t take it.", "After they’re strapped down and the needles are flowing and you’ve got probably forty-five seconds where you and he are together for the last time, and nobody — nobody — can hear what goes on there. And the conversations that took place in there were, well, basically indescribable. It was always something different. A guy would say ’I want you to pray this prayer.’ One of ’em would say ’I just want to tell you thank you.’ One of them would say ’Don’t forget to mail my letters.’ Another one would say ’Just tell me again, is it gonna hurt?’ One of them would say ’What do I say when I see God?’ You’ve got forty-five seconds and you’re trying to tell the guy what to say to God?", "(Music fades out.)", "WILLETT:: At 6:20 I call in a doctor to examine the inmate and pronounce death. This is Mike Graczyk from the Associated Press.", "GRACZYK:: The physician will take a stethoscope, look for a heartbeat or a pulse, shine a light in their eyes, and look at his watch and decide what time it is, and pronounce the time of death. And the warden repeats the time of death. We turn around, the guard opens the door, and we file out.", "BRAZZIL:: At that point all of the witnesses are escorted out immediately and the medical team will then come in and take the IVs out.", "GREEN:: And then we, the team members including myself, go in and unstrap him and then assist in putting him on the funeral home gurney until such time as he’s wheeled out and that’s the end of the process.", "WILLETT:: The procedure is almost always over by 6:25, and we’re free to go. The executions seem to affect all of us differently. Some get quiet and reflective after, others less so, but I have no doubt that it’s disturbing for all of us. It always bothers you. It does me.", "Fred Allen, who used to be part of the tie-down team, participated in about 120 executions before he had to stop. This is the first time Fred has ever talked about his experience publicly.", "FRED ALLEN:: I was just working in the shop and all of a sudden something just triggered in me and I started shaking. And then I walked back into the house and my wife asked ’What’s the matter?’ and I said ’I don’t feel good.’ And tears — uncontrollable tears — was coming out of my eyes. And she said ’What’s the matter?’ And I said ’I just thought about that execution that I did two days ago, and everybody else’s that I was involved with.’ And what it was was something triggered within and it just – everybody — all of these executions all of a sudden all sprung forward.", "WILLETT:: Three years later, Fred can still see the eyes of the men he helped tie down.", "ALLEN:: Just like taking slides in a film projector and having a button and just pushing a button and just watching, over and over: him, him, him. I don’t know if it’s mental breakdown, I don’t know if . . . probably would be classified more as a traumatic stress, similar to what individuals in war had. You know, they’d come back from war, it might be three months, it might be two years, it might be five years, all of a sudden they relive it again, and all that has to come out. You see I can barely even talk because I’m thinking more and more of it. You know, there was just so many of ’em.", "WILLETT:: After sixteen years in the prison system, Fred resigned. He now works as a carpenter.", "ALLEN:: My main concern is right now is these other individuals. I hope that this doesn’t happen to them — the ones that participate, the ones that go through this procedure now. And I will say honestly — and I believe very sincerely — somewhere down the line something is going to trigger. Everybody has a stopping point. Everybody has a certain level. That’s all there is to it.", "WILLETT:: I don’t believe the rest of my officers are going to break like Fred did, but I do worry about my staff. I can see it in their eyes sometimes, particularly when we do a lot of executions in a short period of time. So far this year we’ve done thirty-three, and I’m guessing we’ll get some place close to fifty by the end of 2000. That’ll be a record.", "I’ll be retiring next year and to tell you the truth this is something I won’t miss a bit. There are times when I’m standing there, watching those fluids start to flow, and wonder whether what we’re doing here is right. It’s something I’ll be thinking about for the rest of my life.", "(Music fades in.)", "I’m Warden Jim Willett in Huntsville, Texas."]}

Alongside the controversy over the morality of capital punishment has raged a parallel debate: Should the state’s ultimate act against an individual be enacted in secret? Many in the media have tried to bring their cameras and tape recorders into the execution chamber, but courts have consistently ruled that, although the media do have a place in witnessing executions, they have no right to record the scene.In 1998, however, audio tapes of 22 Georgia executions — tapes recorded by members of the state’s Department of Corrections for their own records — entered the court record when criminal defense lawyer Mike Mears subpoenaed the tapes in a lawsuit he brought challenging the state’s use of the electric chair. Sound Portraits acquired the recordings, and, in conjunction with WNYC, produced .The Execution Tapes is an hour-long public radio special hosted by Ray Suarez featuring excerpts of recordings made in Georgia’s death house during state electrocutions. This broadcast is the first time a national audience is able to hear what takes place during a state-sponsored execution.In addition to audio of the 1984 execution of Ivon Ray Stanley, the program features audio of an execution that had to be “reinitiated” — that is, an execution in which the inmate is still alive after being electrocuted for two minutes, requiring that he be electrocuted again. There is also a selection of inmates’ final statements, recorded immediately before their execution.Excerpts of the tapes are followed by two roundtable discussions about the implications of the tapes’ broadcast. Participants include  co-editor Mike Wallace, First-Amendment lawyer Martin Garbus, former Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers, professor of psychiatry and psychology Robert Jay Lifton, and Diane Clements, president of the victims’ rights organization Justice for All."]}

The discs found their way to the Museum of Radio and Television and, ultimately, to Yiddish radio historian Henry Sapoznik, who gave rapt hearing to the half-century-old proceedings of the Jewish American Board of Peace and Justice, the first court of the air.From the late-1930s to 1956, Rabbi Shmuel Aaron Rubin, the Director of the House of the Sages, presided over a mediation court that convened in one of the synagogue’s back rooms. Flanked by distinguished members of the mediation court, Rabbi Rubin adjudicated every kind of dispute imaginable, from the complaints of abandoned parents to altercations over ill-fitting sheets.Rabbi Rubin’s history on the Lower East Side dated to the early 1930s, when he emigrated from Israel (then Palestine). Arriving in New York’s Jewish enclave, he was dismayed at the plight of the city’s retired rabbis, many of whom led impoverished lives. To correct this sad situation, Rabbi Rubin helped to raise money to support the House of Sages, the first institution of its kind in America, to provide retired Rabbis with a weekly stipend and a place to study.To further the function of the House of Sages, Rabbi Rubin began using it as a site for settling disputes within the community. (There was no charge to the plaintiffs and none of the panel’s members received any compensation.) By the end of the 1930s, the dealings of the Jewish American Board of Peace and Justice, as the mediation court was called, were being recorded and broadcast on Yiddish radio stations like WLTH and WEVD.Plaintiffs who brought their cases to the Board were often too poor of unfamiliar with the American justice system to take their case to the state courts. In Rabbi Rubin’s court disputants could present their complaints in their own language and appeal for ethical justice — as in the case of parents requiring support — even where no legal issues pertained. The Court’s calendar was always booked, and the surviving recordings envelop us whole in the fabric of Jewish American immigrant life.The Jewish Board of Peace and Justice adjourned permanently and went off the air in 1956. Since Rabbi Rubin’s death in 1957, the House of Sages has been carried forward by Rubin’s son-in-law, Dr. Kalman Gershon Neumann, Rabbi of Congregation Zichron Moshe, who continued broadcasting a religious program in Yiddish until last year, when WEVD sold its frequency to Disney/ESPN.

She was moving out of her house in Queens and wondered if Sapoznik might want to haul off some of the materials her husband had left behind. Soon, Sapoznik was making his way down the basement stairs that led to her late husband’s office. When he entered the room, he was astounded.Sapoznik had descended into a veritable King Tut’s tomb of Yiddish radio, where nothing appeared to have changed in decades. All around were stacks of photos, radio scripts, and dozen and dozens of 16″ acetate discs.This was the legacy of Victor Packer, an eccentric broadcaster whom the fates had granted a multi-year license to transmit whatever boiled to the surface of his overheated imagination.From the late-1930s to 1942, Victor Packer served as Jewish Program Director of Brooklyn’s low-budget station WLTH. The title and function don’t sound unusual until you listen to the discs in Packer’s collection and begin to realize that Packer was WLTH’s Jewish division. His charge: to fill — as writer, director, host, and anything else necessary — four hours of radio a day in 15-minute increments, each distinct from the last.The one-time Yiddish theater actor took to the challenge with a total lack of inhibition. Ideas that sprang into his head one day were on the air the next. In one segment, listeners might hear him recite avant-garde literary masterpieces like his epic sound poems about New York City life, which presaged the beat poetry of 1950s America. The recitation over, Packer would metamorphose from bard to buffoon — say, as host of the “Hammer’s Beverage Program,” an insipid children’s show on which Raisele and Sheyndele, “the Happy Twins,” sang cloying Yiddish and English ditties punctuated by senseless patter, with Packer as the butt of every joke.As the day proceeded, Packer co-hosted talent and game shows with his English-language announcer, Norman Warembud, conducted man-in-the-street interviews, acted and directed in serial dramas, and created a variety of programs that still defy categorization. Case in point: the 11-minute “To Marry or Not to Marry,” a heated dialogue on the topic of marriage, in which only one side of the conversation is audible. (Fully seven minutes of the broadcast comprise perfect silence.)Packer sustained his manic production of radio creations until WLTH went off the air in 1942. After that, he hosted the occasional show on several of New York’s other Yiddish stations. But never again would his maverick radio sensibilities be given free rein. Questions in the Air. Hammer’s Beverage Program.Morning’s at Seven  Spies Deprivation  Mendy the Drug Seller.Spies Yentl, Sarava,  Lend Me a Tenor.  Kissing Jessica Stein  Law and OrderIf Victor Packer’s sound poems are lasting literary creations, his man-in-the-street interview shows may well be the most irresistible part of his radio legacy. Recorded between 1937 and 1942, they are a passport to New York’s old Jewish neighborhoods, with one of Yiddish broadcasting’s most peculiar figures as the guide. (Voices of the Street) is radio’s premier use of the man — or, more often, woman — in-the-street format. Its conceit was simple. Every Monday and Thursday, Victor Packer traveled to a different Jewish grocery store in Brooklyn or the Bronx with a huge transcription disc-cutting machine and asked ordinary housewives their opinions on various vital issues. After hearing them out, Packer would offer his enthusiastic approval and reward the respondent with a box (if he really liked her, two) of his sponsor’s products, like Foremost Milk or Sterling Kosher Salt.In the five years Packer conducted the show, he demonstrated a distinct preference for sententious questions like “What is a good man?” or “What is more important: brains or beauty?” The more banal the response, the happier and more approving Packer seemed to be. Inversely, nothing appeared to throw Packer more than when one of his questions hit home. (Witness the episode of Feb. 24, 1939, when Packer inquired, “What scares you most?”)To keep things jaunty, Packer often asked his interviewees to share their favorite recipes for beloved dishes like bread pudding and calf’s foot jelly. What most often ensued was a charming if impossible-to-follow torrent of ingredients, measurements, and techniques, concluding with a promise of complete satisfaction.Packer’s intrepid reporting usually gave more cause for bemusement than culinary delight. But in either case, his novel broadcasting style lets us share a laugh with a few dozen housewives in a neighborhood and world that has long since ceased to exist."]}

As the last great wave of these arrivals landed at Ellis Island in the 1920s, radio was beginning its ascent in American culture. The recent Jewish immigrants embraced the medium, and by the early 1930s, Yiddish radio flourished nationwide. In New York alone, 23 stations broadcast dramas, variety programs, man-on-the street interviews, music, commercials, even editorials in rhyme.The shows ran the gamut of radio genres, but they all shared one important feature: intimacy. “On Yiddish radio,” explains Yiddish radio historian Henry Sapoznik, “no one was bigger than life. Everyone was life. It was a one-to-one ratio between the listeners and the characters on the radio. Listeners didn’t want a window to look out into another world; they wanted a mirror to see their own.”Yiddish radio obliged. There were the searing dramas of Nahum Stutchkoff, which grappled with the difficult reality of Jewish immigrant experience; the mediation program of Rabbi Samuel A. Rubin, who resolved disputes among Jews too poor or disempowered to turn to the civil courts; the advice show of C. Israel Lutsky, whom many listeners trusted more than their rabbi; and the talent shows that turned the microphone to anyone in the neighborhood courageous enough to let his or her voice be aired.The best-remembered and most powerful of all the Yiddish radio stations was WEVD. Created in 1927 by the Socialist Party to honor its recently deceased leader, Eugene Victor Debbs, the station was taken over in 1932 by the leading Yiddish newspaper, . created the most famous Yiddish radio program of all time — , a variety show that aired every Sunday morning at 11:00. Ironically, while hours of relatively obscure programs like  have survived, only a few random moments of  remain. Among them is the show’s remarkable theme song, with its musical allusions to the Socialist anthem “The Internationale” and “La Marseillaise.”Further down the dial were micro stations like WBBC, WVFW, and WARD, which fought one another tooth and nail to control frequencies and wattage hardly powerful enough to reach around the corner. Program directors for these stations sometimes had to fill as many as four hours of air-time a day by themselves. Such was the predicament of the inimitable WLTH program director Victor Packer, who probably took more chances and experimented with more genres than anyone in the history of broadcasting.Yiddish radio reached its apex in the early 1940s and was in near free fall by the mid ’50s. Radio’s loss of prestige to television was only part of the reason. The Holocaust had forever stemmed the flow of Yiddish speakers to America, while many earlier arrivals turned away from Yiddish culture as they assimilated in the New World. Israel’s choice to make Hebrew its official language further marginalized Yiddish as the language of modern Jewish life.Given the fate of the Yiddish language and the unstable recording materials used in the 1930s to early ’50s, it is a miracle that any remnant of the “golden age” of Yiddish radio has survived to see the present day. The Libby Hotel HourFiddler on the Roof The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.The Hammer’s Beverage Program By 1985, when musician/historian Henry Sapoznik showed up at a rummage sale thrown by New York broadcasting legend Joe Franklin, the heyday of Yiddish radio had been all but forgotten. Sapoznik, then the sound archivist at the Yiddish research institute, YIVO, had come to the sale looking for old klezmer 78s. But what Sapoznik wound up tripping over was far rarer: a few dozen aluminum discs, larger and more unusual than any he had ever seen.On the worn-away labels Sapoznik, a native Yiddish speaker, could make out some Yiddish writing: WEVD . . . WBNX . . .  . . .  . . .  He gave Franklin the $30 in his pocket, tracked down an old transcription disc turntable, and sat down to listen to his find. He put on the first disc. A clear, strong voice announced: Yiddish Melodies in Swing . . .”And the band launched into a raucous, swinging rendition of the Passover song “Dayenu.”“It was simply unbelievable, unlike anything I’d ever heard,” Sapoznik recalls. “I felt like I was being transported back in time to this real, living moment in history. I was transfixed.” He was also hooked. Sapoznik spent the next 17 years searching for more such surviving discs.These discs were not your ordinary LPs or 78s. They were transcriptions: single-cut, acetate-coated aluminum discs the stations were required to have on hand in case the Federal Radio Commission showed up with a complaint. The vast majority of these discs were melted down during World War II scrap metal drives or simply disappeared over the decades. The thousand-plus discs Sapoznik succeeded in rescuing were found mostly in attics, storerooms, and dumpsters.But locating the discs was only half the challenge. Acetate-coated discs were never meant to be an archival medium. The materials were quickly disintegrating, and it was only a matter of time before they would pass the point of no return.Yiddish Radio ProjectJewish Caravan of StarsYiddish Radio Project Before digital audiotapes, before cassettes, before even reel to reel, the standard recording medium was the acetate disc. Acetate–a soft, plastic-like coating onto which sound was engraved–was applied to discs made of aluminum, glass, or paper. The sound quality could be quite good, but the medium was never meant to last.Even under the best storage conditions, acetate discs are notorious for exuding a greasy white film, the most apparent sign of nitrocellulose acetate decomposition. Under less than optimal conditions, the acetate coating can shrink and crack like the surface of a desert floor. Sometimes, the acetate’s hold on the aluminum disc becomes so fragile that the acetate coating lifts off as it is being played.Once Henry Sapoznik joined forces with producer Dave Isay and Sound Portraits Productions to begin work on the , Andy Lanset, one of New York’s premier sound preservationists, was brought on to save the discs.In his lab, Lanset would start by examining each disc and choosing the cleaning method best suited to its condition. Some just needed to have the grit and schmutz flushed from their grooves; others had to be treated with special agents to replenish elements leached over time.After cleaning, the right stylus was selected for playback. A stylus that is too narrow can damage a disc, and one that’s too wide won’t get all the sound.During playback, three transfers were made: a reel-to-reel archival master, a compact disc, and a reference DAT used to produce the radio series. After transfer, each acetate disc was given a fresh acid-free sleeve and reshelved in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. (Many of the clips later used in the  NPR series also received a subsequent digital cleanup from Gary Covino, the series’ editor and technical wizard.)After each transfer was completed, the disc information was entered into a database modeled on the extended format used by the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institute. In 2004 the audio collection, together with reams of related papers and photographs, will be transferred to the Library of Congress.Yiddish Radio Project Overtly Jewish characters were not confined to Yiddish radio. They were also a staple of mainstream shows.Mrs. Pansy Nussbaum was a regular on , as were Mr. Schlepperman and Mr. Kitzel on . Unlike the varied, dynamic Jewish personages heard on Yiddish radio, though, these characters tended to be remarkable above all for their overblown accents and love of “exotic” foods like herring.The model for these Jewish stereotypes was a series of 78 rpm records cut between the late teens and early ’20s that featured the character of Mr. Cohen, an exaggeratedly malapropistic Jew who could barely make himself understood.Another stereotypical Jewish character was that of the wise elder, like Papa David Solomon in , who usually came off sounding like everyone’s idea of an Old Testament sage. Such characterizations were not racist per se, just stereotypical, much like the radio representations of other ethnic groups, like the Italian Luigi in .The exception was , a radio program that evolved into a T.V. show, and which portrayed Jews as regular people with regular problems. Irregular problems, however — miscegenation, intergenerational strife, the grungy day-to-day struggles of immigrant life — were the exclusive domain of Yiddish radio."]}

These recordings are as close as we’ll ever get to hearing what life was like in the tenements of New York City in the 1930s and ’40s.When not writing or acting in one of his eight weekly radio programs, Stutchkoff penned reference books, including a monumental Yiddish thesaurus that breathes with the linguist’s genius.

Each week listeners were brought into the home of a Jewish family coping with the problems of immigrant life.While most dramas on the American radio dial offered escapist fantasies, Stutchkoff’s creations writhed with actuality. His characters were hewn from the stuff of real life, facing difficulties their listeners knew well: the alienation of the older generation, racism within the Jewish community, miscegenation, the conflicts between secular America and Jewish religiousness.Though a private man who worked in extreme seclusion, Stutchkoff felt bound to the community that was the source of his artistic inspiration.  His wife and children often found him crying at his writing desk over the fate of the radio characters he had just created. If he did not weep over them, he asked, who would?The 26  episodes salvaged by the  are the only of Stutchkoff’s half-dozen radio series to have survived. Not a single broadcast remains of  (People’s Troubles), Stutchkoff’s most popular show, which ran on WEVD for two decades and helped raise donations for the Brooklyn Jewish Home for Chronic Diseases. But one child actor on the program —  Isaiah Sheffer, host of WNYC’s Selected Shorts and the artistic director of New York City’s Symphony Space — remembers it well.“It was totally frantic,” Sheffer recalls. “Everything was last-minute and done quickly, with all the actors learning their parts along with Stutchkoff.” The writer-director often passed freshly penned lines of script to actors at the mike, a situation par for the course in the radio universe of Nahum Stutchkoff.Bei Tate-mames Tish  ForvertsBei Tate-Mames Tish Bei Tate-mames TishIn a Jewish Grocery One Thousand and One Nights  Shiker and Schlimazel Tsures ba Leitn Born in Brok, Poland, in 1893, Nahum Stutchkoff had an early and unerring ear for language. Speaking Yiddish, Polish, and Russian before he learned Hebrew in Jewish day school, Stutchkoff picked up French and German after breaking with his religious upbringing at 16 to join the Yiddish theater.In 1923 he boarded a boat to America and disembarked two weeks later speaking English, having read William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, and the  on the way over. But his greatest love was for the Yiddish language. His Yiddish rhyming dictionary, published in 1931, won him great renown among playwrights, intelligentsia, and the general Yiddish public.With the ink on the rhyming dictionary barely dry, Stutchkoff began work on a thesaurus of the Yiddish language — a Herculean endeavor to which Stutchkoff devoted increasing time and energy, while still writing, directing, and acting in eight radio programs a week. In creating this repository of twelve centuries of Yiddish culture and experience, Stutchkoff read virtually everything ever published in Yiddish — from religious treatises to literary works to daily newspapers, which he cataloged on 3-1/2 x 5-inch index cards his children can recall jutting from every pocket. This philological passion also served as the inspiration for two radio shows: , literally “mother tongue” — how native speakers refer to Yiddish —  and  (As Mother Used to Say).Published in 1950, the 933-page  (Thesaurus of the Yiddish Language) inventoried the culture’s every expression, from its most ethereal allusions to its juiciest vulgarities. The tome contained 392 synonyms for the word “hit,” more than 100 words and expressions for “chutzpah,” and seven pages of curses — inverted blessings, mostly, since cursing is forbidden in Judaism. (Example: “You should have a hundred houses; in every house a hundred rooms; in every room twenty beds, and a delirious fever should drive you from one bed to the next.”)Arguably the greatest one-man lexicographical accomplishment of all time, his thesaurus was a final, emphatic statement on the wealth of Yiddish, made at the moment the language heaved its last great secular sigh. After completing the thesaurus, Stutchkoff immediately embarked on his final lexicographic undertaking: a Hebrew thesaurus. Begun shortly after the establishment of the Jewish state, it marked an important moment in the modernization of the Hebrew language. He worked on it through his last days as a patient at the Brooklyn Jewish Home for Chronic Diseases, his one-time sponsor.Nowhere, perhaps, did Stutchkoff flex his linguistic muscle more than in his ad copy, especially for Manischewitz Matzo. For thousands of years matzo has been made from three simple ingredients — water, flour, and salt. Yet each time Nahum Stutchkoff pitched it, the bread of affliction came off as something different. It was “clear,” “burnished,” “pearl-like,” “thousand-flavored,” “crispy,” and “bright as the rising sun.” It was a model of modern factory production and a living link to the scattered tribes of ancient Israel. It was the path to culinary delight and the manna of spiritual sustenance.But Stutchkoff’s greatest matzo pitch was his starkly direct “Manischewitz Matzo” jingle, featuring the simply beguiling lyrics “Manischewitz Matzo, buy, buy, buy.” The song, so popular it was copyrighted and the sheet music sold in stores, was a regular feature on Stutchkoff’s WLTH children’s talent show, “Uncle Nahum’s Kidkins,” where the Barry Sisters, among others, got their start.The lyrics to the “Manischewitz Matzo” song were transliterated so that the American-born kidkins could read them easily."]}

Jazz and klezmer. It may sound like an odd combination, but in late 1937 this mix of Old World and New took the music scene here and abroad by storm. The fad got its start when the Andrews Sisters, a young three-sibling act fresh from Minnesota, recorded an irresistible swing version of a forgotten Yiddish stage tune. “Bei Mir Bist du Schoen” (You Are Beautiful to Me) became an instantaneous hit, spawning an unending series of covers and, with them, a musical trend.Within weeks, executives at New York’s WHN had created , a weekly program dedicated to the new musical fusion. The talented pianist/composer Sam Medoff was hired to lead the show’s “Swingtet” and to arrange rollicking versions of traditional Jewish folk and klezmer tunes like “Dayenu,” “Eli Meylakh,” and “Yidl Mitn Fidl.”Front and center on Medoff’s bandstand were the Barry Sisters (née Bagelman), whose close-as-air harmonies, spunky energy, and seamless transitions from Yiddish to English packed New York’s 600-seat Loews State Theater every Sunday at 1 p.m. But  didn’t just mainstream Yiddish culture, it reconnected a younger generation of American Jews to an older musical tradition embodied by the Swingtet’s legendary clarinetist, Dave Tarras, a European-born klezmer musician with almost no equal. lasted nearly two decades, outliving swing, the golden age of radio, and almost Yiddish culture itself.

Yiddish Melodies in Swing.Yiddish Melodies in SwingYiddish Melodies in Swing.The story of this tune’s stratospheric rise is as unlikely as that of Yiddish swing itself. “Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen” was composed by Sholom Secunda for a 1932 Yiddish musical that opened and closed in one season. Fast-forward to 1937. Lyricist Sammy Cahn and pianist Lou Levy were catching a show at the Apollo Theater in Harlem when two black performers called Johnnie and George took the stage singing “Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen” — in Yiddish. The crowd went wild. Cahn and Levy couldn’t believe their ears. Sensing a hit, Cahn convinced his employer at Warner Music to purchase the rights to the song from the Kammen Brothers, the twin-team music entrepreneurs who had bought the tune from Secunda a few years back for the munificent sum of $30.Cahn gave “Bei Mir” a set of fresh English lyrics and presented it to a trio of Lutheran sisters whose orchestra leader, oddly enough named Vic Schoen, had a notion of how to swing it. The Andrews Sisters’ debut 78 rpm for the Decca label hit almost immediately. The era of Yiddish swing had begun.“Bei Mir” would soon be covered by virtually every pop and jazz artist of the age, and was even retranslated into French, Swedish, Russian — and German. (The song was a hit in Hitler’s Germany until the Nazi Party discovered that its composer was a Jew, and that the song’s title was Yiddish rather than a south German dialect.)The song’s success also sparked frenzied searches for other Yiddish crossover hits. Some attempts, like “Joseph, Joseph” (“Yosl, Yosl”), by the team of Chaplin and Cahn for the Andrews, and “My Little Cousin” (“Di Grine Kuzine”), by Benny Goodman, found modest success. But no Yiddish song would ever hit it as big again.Sammy Cahn claimed that he bought his mother a house with money earned from “Bei Mir.” For her part, the mother of Sholom Secunda visited the synagogue every day for a quarter century to ask God for forgiveness, certain that he was punishing her son for a sin she had committed., December 24, 1937, August 24, 1952Men Ken Lebn Nor Men Lost Nisht (I Would If I Could)Dave Tarras, the  clarinetist, was brought up in the world of klezmer, the traditional instrumental music of Eastern European Jews. But he was no stranger to the New World technology of radio.Apart from his longstanding gig on , Tarras was the musical director of the low-power WBBC (Brooklyn Broadcasting Company), where he played old-fashioned  and sweet waltzes between programs, tailoring the name of his ensemble to whoever was footing the bill. His band could start the afternoon as Dave Tarras and the WBBC Ensemble, transform fifteen minutes later into Dave Tarras and the Breakstone Ensemble, and round out the hour as Dave Tarras and the Stanton Street Clothiers Ensemble.Key to Tarras’s success were his extraordinary music reading ability and his capacity to show up to a gig sober and on time. Neither quality was shared by Tarras’s chief rival, Naftule Brandwein — the other leading contender for the title of the twentieth century’s greatest klezmer clarinetist.Brandwein was Tarras’s opposite in almost every respect. Unable to read a note of music, he preferred the poker table to the bandstand and the liquor bottle to just about everything else. Onstage he wore an Uncle Sam outfit wrapped in Christmas lights, which blew up one night as his perspiration got out of hand. His playing was as rough and wild as his temperament, laced with elements of Greek, Turkish, and Gypsy music.Brandwein was a fearless musician, always teetering on the edge of disaster. A favorite of Murder Incorporated, for whom he performed in a famed hideaway behind a Brooklyn candy store, the talented iconoclast left a lasting mark on the development of klezmer music.Aficionados of the genre argue to this day about which of the two klezmer masters, Tarras or Brandwein, was the greatest.

The program, , was sponsored by the United Service for New Americans, a Jewish philanthropic organization aimed at reforming the 1924 anti-immigration laws that continued to keep Jews and other Eastern Europeans from the safe haven of America. By masking its grave mission in the guise of popular entertainment, the organization struck the only blow it could against the Fourth Estate’s stonewalling of Third Reich abominations.The format of , like the popular radio series , was to bring together, live on the air, people whose reconnections would hit home with listeners. On July 6, 1947, those connections were diverse: a Sgt. Miles Riley was reunited with his wife; one Bill Clemis of Albany, N.Y., came face-to-face with a childhood friend from India; Ezra (“Henry Aldrich”) Stone planned a reunion party for his class from the School of Dramatic Arts in New York; and — in a story unlike anything heard on radio before or since — the Holocaust survivor Siegbert Freiberg was reunited with his beloved father.In its final episode, the Yiddish Radio Project reexamines that historic broadcast through the other end of the telescope. Our work on this program — and on the Yiddish Radio Project as a whole — was profoundly influenced by our association with Freiberg, who died on April 20, 2002. We are grateful beyond words for having known him.During the Second World War, the American mainstream press did not cover the mass slaughter of Europe’s Jews. As early as 1933 the columnist and commentator Walter Winchell condemned Nazi activities, only to be squelched by the notoriously anti-Semitic William Randolph Hearst. Reports on the roundup of civilians were occasionally published. And it was no secret that Jews were chief among those targeted. But Hitler’s plan to systematically exterminate all Jews under his power was simply never reported.To be sure, that failure can be attributed to the Third Reich’s success at maintaining a shroud of secrecy around its most abominable acts. And when rumors of mass executions, human slaughterhouses, and depraved scientific experiments did emerge, most people found them impossible to believe.But it is now clear that by early 1942 the United States government was aware of the ongoing industrial murder of Jews and suppressed that knowledge. The war was not going well for the Allies, and the last thing the U.S. Office of War Information wanted to foster was the perception that World War Two was being fought to save Jews.The American public at large first learned of the depths of the Holocaust on April 16, 1945, when, in the closing days of the war, Edward R. Murrow described the scene at the just-liberated concentration camp Buchenwald. But several earlier radio broadcasts discovered by Yiddish radio historian Henry Sapoznik provided stark imagery of the fate of Jews living across the Atlantic. One such broadcast is the May 7, 1941, “Cable from Lisbon,” written by and featuring Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman. Funded by the Joint Distribution Committee a Jewish refugee relief agency, the dramatization depicted the fate of Jews in a French town under German occupation.Another is a speech by Solomon Mikhoels, director of the Moscow Yiddish Art Theater and co-chair of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet agency that sponsored his 1943 lecture series in America. Mikhoels’ graphic accounts of German atrocities — including the famed but ultimately unproven allusions to soap made from victims’ bodies — had strong and lasting repercussions.After the war, Jewish relief agencies like the United Jewish Appeal sponsored English-language radio dramas including “My Town” and “Little Old Man,” which documented the difficulties of Holocaust survivors in America and their new unwary hosts. In them, as in the July 6, 1947,  broadcast, we can witness America’s early attempts to come to terms with one of history’s greatest tragedies."]}

We’d have a cake, and the guys I worked with they would take a milk container, and they’d cut out the facsimile of a building. And they’d put it on top of the cake, and then they would light it up. And they would tell Joe to put it out. And he would throw a pot of water on it. The birthday cake was a little soggy, but this is what he wanted. Joe started dating a young lady whose father was a police officer. And he come home one day and he says, ”I’m taking the police test.” I says, ”Joe, you’re only 17 years old.” He says, ”ah, no big deal.” He passed the test.

He was going to make a million dollars and take care of his mother and father. But in 1984, I came down with throat cancer. He noticed then how my unit took care of us. And he says, ”I’m going to become a fireman.” I says, ”you’re kidding me. Fireman don’t make millions of dollars. How am I going to live like a king?” But I was very happy, very proud. My father had been on the fire department, and he was the first one to be issued badge number 3436. And when John decided he wanted to be a firefighter, they reissued it to my son John. So the badge is only used by two. Both the boys would call me when they were working. John would always call around 3:30 — 4 o’ clock. And that particular night, September 10th, we spoke for a few minutes.

And actually the night we got him, the sheriff’s department was supposed to hit the house about the same time I did, I went in first and unbeknownst to me, they were about ten minutes behind me. We didn’t know that was a drug lab and I walked right in the middle of it. They took me down and began to beat me pretty good. They broke my jaw and knocked out a couple of my teeth with some old pliers. And then they began to pull the teeth out as I wouldn’t answer questions. Of course I couldn’t answer the questions because I was in too much pain. So I was sure proud to see when the sheriffs department did break in there and get me out of that.

She was sitting on her mother’s lap at a high school football game when her mother noticed that her eyes were yellow and she was acting a little tired. By the time we brought her into the hospital it was pretty clear that her liver was failing and was not likely to recover and we began very quickly the process of listing her for possible transplant. Seven, eight, nine days went by and there wasn’t a donor available. On the tenth day, when we thought we had a lead on a donor, she had a sudden worsening. And even as we were trying to make the decision whether we were going to go ahead with the transplant, her brain function changed to the point where it was clear we couldn’t. There was little chance that she was going to recover. So after working with that family every day for ten days, just taking each, really each hour as it came, I had to talk with them about the fact that we couldn’t go ahead. And as we gathered around her bed, her parents spontaneously turned to us and said, “Well is there any chance that her organs could help another?” And as it turned out they could. And they wound up donating her kidneys, her pancreas, her corneas. And later I saw a photo of all the recipients, and it was one of the most moving photos I’ve ever seen. Here was a family that was desperately waiting for a transplant and they wound up turning around and giving at a time when no one would have expected it, and wound up touching a number of individuals and really giving them a new chance at life. That’s one of my more memorable days. And I don’t think I had much to do with it.", "CB: I always wonder how you move through all of these patients and the success stories and then the losses, and somehow there seems to be hope.", "JB: Yeah. I think there is and it comes in a variety of forms. Children have such a resilience and bounce back and heal in ways that always amaze me.

She was a friend, she was just my very best friend and I really miss that. Probably the most wonderful thing she gave me, in addition to just some strength of character, was four-hundred and fifty to five hundred letters of mine, that I wrote her, that she saved for me. And we found these five hundred letters when we were cleaning out her house, they were stuffed in the back of a little cupboard. And some of the things that were captured in those letters, a really good sense of how much she meant to me, for example, I never kept a diary in high school, instead, I just wrote letters to Meff, and I knew she would never divulge them and I knew she would respect what I was saying. So, you know, starting in seventh grade, she got a litany of letters about boy troubles. In a letter I wrote to her back in 1962 I was complaining about boys again, and I started with this, ”Dear Meff, all this is, is one big sob story, so be prepared.” And then I go on for like three pages of notepaper. It was like having my own personal Ann Landers. So at the end of the letter I say, ”But then, what are aunts for.” So I mail that on a Wednesday and the next Monday she writes me a response. And this letter is kind of worn and torn, and it’s a testimony to how many times I looked at that letter in the course of my life. And she says, ”Dear Karen, enclosed is a prompt answer to your question, ’What are aunts for?’ Well, I found this quote years ago In a book called Mrs. Miniver, and here’s what I think aunts are for: ’Aunts are to be a pattern and example to all aunts, and to show that at least one daughter in any generation, in every generation ought to remain unmarried and raise the profession of aunt-ship to a fine art.’” She ends by saying, ”Thank you, Karen, for reminding me of this. I shall have to keep trying again and again to live up to it.” And I would have to say that she not only raised aunt-ship to that high art, I would say, that Meff was probably the gold standard."]}

And just don’t ask me. Just, just go do it for me, would you please?” So I said, ”Sure, no problem.” So I went and I loaded up the garage with all the stuff he had asked me get.

And we get out to the garage and he’s got shovels and rakes and coffee cans full of bouquets. And I said, ”What are we doing?” And he goes, ”We’re doing the graves. Just, just be quiet and let’s go.” So we get in the car and he’d packed a lunch and we started driving around the cemetery looking for graves. And I said, ”Well, who are these people?” And he said, ”Well, these are the people that helped me through my life. And they don’t have any relatives and they don’t have any survivors and every year I do their graves.” So we stopped at a grave and it was the Torpey’s. Mr. and Mrs. Torpey. And I said, ”So, who are these people? I’ve never heard of ’em.” And he said, ”Well, we were poor. We didn’t have anything. And when I needed to learn how to drive a car, Mr. Torpey taught me how to drive a car. And when I had to have a car to go on a date or something, Mr. Torpey would loan me his Buick.” That’s pretty much how the day went.

James T. Molloy (JM): Well, I thought everybody’s father was a policeman or a fireman. TR: What was your dad? JM: My father was a fireman. Worked in the same firehouse for 37 years down in what they call the old first ward, the Irish neighborhood near the waterfront: truck eight, engine eight. TR: Did your dad have a second job occasionally? JM: Oh, yeah. Many jobs. There weren’t many people who had one job. TR: We call it the second front. JM: The second front. You got it. TR: Now, when your dad was off working, he probably couldn’t go to some of the events at school and some of the other things. JM: Very true. Yeah. I went to a local high school in south Buffalo. I was playing ball one day over at ”Kaz” park and I looked up and there was the hook and ladder, truck eight, which my father was the driver. TR: (laughter) And it just so happened… JM: And it just happened to be at ”Kaz” park where the ball diamond was, you know. And you grew up in that same atmosphere so you understand it, you know. TR: Uh-huh. So you came to Washington and you’re the doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. JM: Yeah, it was a big deal. TR: What was it like the first time you walked down that aisle and said, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. JM: The first one was President Jerry Ford. I was perspiring and everything, I mean I was in the job only a short period of time, about three, four weeks. TR: What did your mom and dad say when they saw their son? JM: My father never made a big deal of anything. But my mother, she just loved it. She could get any conversation turned to that, you know. TR: (laughter) Well we had at NBC, Tom Brokaw would be anchoring, and I would send Tom little notes, and I would say, okay, Jimmy’s about to introduce the President of the United States, let’s lay it on tonight. And Tom would say, ”you’re about to hear the voice of James…” JM: He was great. TR: ”T. Malloy, the proud son of Cathrine Malloy of, was it, 106 Bloomfield?” JM: You got it. TR: 106 Bloomfield Avenue. And finally, your last hurrah, he said, ”you’re about to hear the voice of James T. Malloy, an extrodinary man, a gifted firefighter, a man who studied the law, I would say in every sense of the word, a true renaissance man.” JM: Well, when all this would go on, you know, it would play in all the local saloons in south Buffalo, and all the firehouses, and they would be watching this thing. One fireman turned to the other and said, ”what the hell did he, what did he call him?” And he said, ”he called him a reservoir man or something.” They later found out after looking it up that it was kind of a compliment, you know. TR: It was indeed. JM: Yeah, yeah. TR: Now you left the doorkeeper position when? JM: Ninety-four. Ninety-four. TR: When Newt Gingrich, the Republican… JM: When Newt Gingrich abolished the doorkeeper. My last official act was to introduce Newt Gingrich as the speaker, and then I raced down, filed my papers… TR: So you retired. JM: I retired, yeah. TR: Before we go, the best way I ever described you James T. Malloy, was a good man who knew everybody and was always proud of taking care of his own. JM: Well, I’ll accept that. I like that. Again, you always look back to where you started from. Where you started from, where I started from. You know, and Washington’s a great place. TR: But it’s no south Buffalo. JM: No, it’s no south Buffalo. TR: (laughter) Amen. James T. Malloy, thank you very much. JM: Thank you, Tim."]}

The building, located across the street from an abandoned bowling alley, is an oasis of color. Huge signs beckon ”We marry you $49, no appointment necessary” and ”Hock it to me.”", " One of my slogans out here at this place is ”When you’re in the mood to say I do, and you really care, think of Kipperman’s Wedding Chapel, where love is always in the air.”", "ISAY: As you may have guessed, that is Ted Kipperman, the mastermind of this operation. An enormous painted portrait of the man takes up an entire side of the building. He looks distinctly pope-like in his chaplain’s outfit — a long white robe, a red stole draped around his neck.", "The inside of Kipperman’s Pawn Shop is packed with the usual assortment of hockables– TVs, VCRs, toasters and tools, glass display cases of jewelry and racks of guns.", " This is a 25-caliber pistol, $79.95 . . .", "People always kid me and say, ”This is the only place in town you can get married and buy a gun all at the same time.”", "This is a .38 right here. Boy, that will stop ’em.", "ISAY: The genesis of this odd combination of businesses dates back to the early 1980s. Houston had hit particularly tough economic times, and customers were hocking huge numbers of wedding rings. Kipperman says that he just couldn’t bring himself to melt any of them down.", " There’s too many memories.", "ISAY: It became an obsession for Kipperman. His collection of surplus wedding rings grew and grew and grew until one day, in 1984, when Kipperman reached his breaking point.", " I woke up one morning in a cold sweat. What am I going to do with those wedding rings? So God spoke to me and said, ’Maybe a wedding chapel will be a good thing to put in that pawnshop.’", "ISAY: Kipperman followed this divine inspiration. He wrote away to the National Chaplains Association and got himself ordained. Then, sparing no expense, he installed a chapel in his pawnshop. It’s hard to miss. At the back of the store Kipperman has built a miniature church façade — complete with columns and fake stained glass windows, the whole structure adorned with blinking Christmas lights. On an easel next to the chapel entrance sits a big-framed color photograph of Kipperman.", " Oh, so happy to see you here, right on time for your wedding.", "ISAY: Kipperman’s first couple of the day has arrived, Ernest and Lucy — a handsome pair who live in the neighborhood and say they were drawn to Kipperman through his ”Buy a ring, get a free wedding” offer.", " Come right in here.", "ISAY: Kipperman leads the couple through two frosted glass doors into his wedding chapel, a small plush room with a few rows of cushioned pews.", " Stand right here.", "ISAY: Kipperman positions the couple at the front of the chapel, and stands before them inside a seven foot tall wrought-iron heart, threaded with plastic flowers. He hits the play button on an old cassette recorder.", "(Tape of ”The Wedding March” plays.)", " Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join Lucy and Ernest in marriage. They’re getting married today. Why? Because they’re in love with each other.", "ISAY: Ernest and Lucy have opted for Kipperman’s bargain basement wedding, passing on all of the extras he offers — like the $14.95 bouquet, a $50 value.", " I have a wedding gown here that if they’d like to rent, that’ll be $20.", "If they want to have a videotape of the wedding, I’ve got a video camera I can come in here and shoot it with it.

Whom God . . .", "ISAY: As is wont to happen, Kipperman is overcome by the emotion of the moment.", " Whom God has joined together let no man put asunder. Ernest, you may now kiss the bride.", "Well, congratulations. I have Mr. Ernest and Lucy Duran. Thank you very much for letting me officiate. Thank you, Mrs. Duran. Now stand right there . . .", "ISAY: One of Kipperman’s clerks, Carl Davis, sits at the chapel’s Baldwin organ — which, incidentally, can be purchased for a mere $200 — and plays.", "(Sounds of organ music.)", "In keeping with tradition, Ted Kipperman poses the newlyweds, Ernest and Lucy, for a complimentary Polaroid. They toast empty plastic champagne glasses in front of a fake, albeit realistic-looking, wedding cake.", " I have to change the cake out about every four or five months because people try to eat the cake.", " Have you ever had anyone actually get married and then come in later and hock their wedding ring?", " Well, once in a while they’ll come in when they get down on their luck, but most people, they pick up their wedding rings up after they pawn them. Once in a while, they’ll come in and tell me they don’t want their wedding rings anymore because they think they’re gonna get a divorce and do I do annulments. And I say, ”No, I don’t do annulments. My weddings are always for better or for worse.”", "ISAY: No sooner have the newlywed Durans departed, than Rose Martinez shows up at the pawnshop. She is here without her betrothed, a man named Michael Smith who, she explains, is currently locked up at the state’s maximum security penitentiary. He’s been there for eight years. Rose and Michael have decided that now is as good a time as any to tie the knot — by telephone.", " I guess we don’t want to loose each other. But by the time he comes out he’ll be 50-something years old and I’ll be 50-something years old, but I love him. I love him very much, and he loves me too, so I guess that’s what counts.", "ISAY: A wedding by proxy. Kipperman knows the routine well. Rose has brought with her a marriage license and the prison’s phone number. That is all Kipperman needs to join the two in holy matrimony. Unfortunately, there’s no telephone in the chapel, so the ceremony takes place out front.", " We’ll have to do this one across the counter.", " It don’t matter, as long as I’m married to the man I really love.", " Oh, is this the Eastham Unit? Is Warden Martin there?", "ISAY: As it turns out, the groom is unreachable. So, Ted Kipperman has the prison chaplain stand in for Michael Smith at the penitentiary. And, on this end, who to stand in and exchange rings with the bride? Well, I do the honors.", " Dearly beloved, we’re gathered here today to join Michael and Rosario in marriage.", "ISAY: I have to admit, we were both a little nervous. But Kipperman, with his sugary smile and sure-footed execution of the ceremony, puts us right at ease.", " Rosario, do you take Michael to be your lawfully wedded husband, to live with him according to God’s holy ordinances?", " I do.", " And we have a stand in for the groom Mr. David Isay. You do vow to take care of her and do everything according to God’s holy ordinances? Say, ”I do.”", " I do.", " Well then, by the authority of the State of Texas, and my authority as a chaplain, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. Congratulations.", "(Organ music.)", "ISAY: And so another couple is joined in matrimony. Just add them to the long list of satisfied customers who’ve found love at this most unlikely locale, Kipperman’s Pawn Shop and Wedding Chapel in Houston, Texas.", "For National Public Radio, I’m David Isay.", " I appreciate it a whole lot.

It’s a blip on the map, an unincorporated hamlet about ninety miles north of Houston on Highway 59. It’s a safe bet that if driving by you would simply miss Moscow, but if you slowed down enough to look at the small welcome to Moscow sign posted on the side of the road, you would see that the town has a motto: ”I Thought I Saw a Dinosaur.” That is because Moscow is home to Dinosaur Gardens. The theme park is located right across the highway from the town’s only other attraction, the Moscow tattoo studio. It sits in the woods behind a white picket fence, which reads ”Prehistoric animals in their natural habitat.”", " I’m trying to keep this, as much as I can, like it would have been back then.", " Donald Bean is the creator of this roadside attraction. If you journey into Dinosaur Gardens, chances are you’ll find Bean all by himself tending to his beloved creatures.", " This dinosaur here, I pulled a squirrel’s nest out of his mouth one day last week.", " Donald Bean is a retired carpenter. He’s a large, lumbering man dressed in blue denim overalls, coke-bottle glasses resting low on his nose.", " What is it about dinosaurs that appeals to you?", " Well, first the fact that they are big, and they ruled the world for years, you know, thousands of years, millions of years. I just like ’em, just because they are unusual. Something different, I guess.", " Donald Bean’s Dinosaur Gardens consists of exactly eleven weathered fiberglass dinosaurs laid out along a winding trail cut into the woods behind his house. Bean opened up the Dinosaur Gardens in 1981, the culmination of a life-long fascination with these prehistoric creatures. Bean says that the genesis of the theme park came about in the late 1980’s, when he and his wife, on vacation, happened upon a similar roadside attraction in Oregon.", " I knew what I wanted as soon as I saw that. I said ”That’s what I want to do,” so I did it.", " It took Bean twenty-five years of planning and saving money from his carpentry work before he was finally ready to unveil his plans for a dinosaur theme park right in the heart of Moscow, Texas.", " What did your wife think of the idea?", " She didn’t like it at first. She wasn’t too fir it because we spent out life savings on it, you know, what we saved all our lives.", " The park cost the Beans nearly one hundred thousand dollars. Most of that money went to a local east Texas craftsman named Burt Holster, whose fiberglass animal work had, up to that point, primarily been featured on top of fast food restaurants, and as high school mascots. Donald Bean says that collaborating with a man of Holster’s artistic temperament was something new for him.", " Well, if you’re talking to him, he may or may not answer you. His mind is working on a dinosaur or something. He may never answer, he may not have heard you, he didn’t hear nothing you said, and you’re standing as close as we are.", " When Donald Bean finally opened up Dinosaur Gardens, twelve years ago, it was met with just about the level of enthusiasm one might anticipate for a dinosaur theme park in the middle of nowhere. The masses did not seem to share Bean’s fervor for creatures prehistoric. There were no lines at the ticket office.", " Did it depress you that not as many people came as you had expected?", " No, it didn’t really depress me. It kind of disappointed me.", "The disappointment remains to this day. For 12 years now, business has been slow at Dinosaur Gardens. There are two ways to look at the situation. There is a downside to be sure. Bean’s wife of forty-three years, Yvonne, had to come out of retirement and take a job at a nearby convenient store to help support her husband’s dinosaur habit. But there is an up side as well. With visitors scarce, Donald Beam can spend as much time as he wants alone in his theme park, pondering his dinosaurs.", " In the evening, or the mornings, I just saunter down through here, you know, and not go fast, just go slow and look ’em over. And if you’ve got a lot of imagination, you just feel like you’re back in time, you know. You can think what these things can do, or what they do when you’re not here or something. I like this one. I think, in your imagination, he’d move slow and sluggish, unless something scared him, or he was running something for food. In that case he’d be real fast. And if you’re walking down here, unless you’re a little kid, you know they’re not going to bother you, and so you can walk along and imagine all the good things about them. Now this is a Macedon. He’s a meat eater, he’s vicious, and this fur on his back . . .", " There is something of an otherworldly quality to Dinosaur Gardens, maybe it’s the dinosaurs, maybe it’s Donald Bean. Imperfections abound, like the unsightly ring of green pond around the Lazmasaurous, who resides in the Dinosaur Gardens swamp. But, all in all, it’s difficult not to get swept up in the charm of this place.", " That’s a beauty.", " Yeah. These dinosaurs here, see that big one standing out — he’s looking right at us as we come down the trail — got his egg, like he’d fixing to take off running.", " If you could do it all over again, would you build the park?", "Yeah, I really would. It’s my home.", " Starting this coming weekend, dinosaur gardens will be open seven days a week through Labor Day.", "It costs a dollar fifty for children and two-fifty for adults.", " A small price to pay, indeed, to take a trip back in time with Donald bean, creator of Dinosaur Gardens in Moscow, Texas."]}

And uh, I don’t know, it was weird. I remember trying to cry when they told me, but I couldn’t. The sound, it was like when somebody is really, spiritually hurt, they make a weird sound. And a sound that scared me really bad. I remember listening to the sound coming out of me, and I said ”I’m gonna die if I let this sound come out,” so I choked it off and I just sat there. And the social worker ran across the side of the table, and she was trying to get me to cry, or have some kind of reaction, and I wouldn’t do it. I got up and left. Couple of days later, right, I cried in my room by myself, I wouldn’t let anybody see me. And my whole fucking body turned blood red, all over. OK? Everything swelled way up.

It was a Catholic foster home. And I started trying to do good in school, because now the focus was on academic ability.

How much money will you give me?” And he says ”I’ll give you $100.” I said, ”Okay.” So we went to this motel in the afternoon, and it was really nice. He was very sexy, and very gentle, and playful, and I thought to myself, ”That’s what this is supposed to be like?

Customers sit shoulder-to-shoulder on swivel chairs. A sign with the day’s special swings from gold chains over the take-out counter: Liver and onions, $2.99.

All of the waitresses and all of the customers were white. There were no signs prohibiting blacks from eating at the lunch counter, she says. Everyone just knew. The policy went unchallenged until February 1st, 1960, when four freshmen from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina sat down at this counter. Geneva Tisdale was working that day.", "TISDALE:: At first I thought it was — I said it was somebody being funny. I remember passing and I saw them sitting there and I kept walking. But then every time somebody would pass by them, they would ask if they could be served. They wanted — asked for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee. And everybody passed by them — just told them that they couldn’t serve them. So that made me kind of nervous, and I went on back to the back and I stayed back there.", "ISAY:: At the time, Geneva Tisdale was pregnant with her third child and was sent home to wait out the sit-ins. The protests grew quickly. On the second day, there were twenty-eight students sitting at the counter. On the third, there were sixty, occupying all of the luncheonette seats all day. By the sixth day, there were one thousand demonstrators in this Woolworth’s. The management decided to close the counter down. It reopened two weeks later, still segregated. The students and Woolworth’s negotiated for five months, until the store finally announced in July that there would be a change in policy. Geneva Tisdale says that she and two of her coworkers in the kitchen were chosen to be the first African-Americans to eat at the lunch counter.

Artie got off the stand to go back for lunch and I said, ”Artie, will you bring me back a Jones Beach hotdog?” You know, I was getting hungry. And he said ”Okay, Jonesy,” and he went off. Well, somehow he never came back to that particular stand, and in a day or two, into the service he went.", "Well, I lost track of Artie, and I often wondered what happened with good old Artie that went into the service. Forty years later, I’m standing on 2-West, the exact same stand that Artie got off of. I look down, and — lo and behold — walking by in front of me was Artie Wink. Now, you understand, this is forty years later, and somehow I recognize him. He had come back to settle his mother’s estate and he was with his twenty-five year old daughter, and he was pointing out to her where he worked as a young man. When I looked down and saw him I said ”Artie, Artie Wink! Where’s my hotdog? I’m sitting up here for forty years, where have you been?” Well, you ever see a guy take a double take? This was a triple take. ”Jonesy!” he said. He literally gasped for air. He said, ”I can’t believe it! You’re still here?” I said, ”Where do you want me to go? I’m getting hungry!”"]}

I mean, anybody who commits this kind of crime probably has gone through something in their lives. But then again, I look at other kids, and like you’re saying, for example, you grew up in that community. Well, look what you’re doing. It’s a far cry from committing first degree murder. So I think it’s a part of it. It’s a piece of it that definitely that needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed long before I see these kids, because by the time they come to me and I have to prosecute them, the deed’s already done.

To start with, I wasn’t in the class that John Steinbeck called the Okies, because my dad to start with was worth about thirty-five or forty thousand dollars. He had everything hunky-dory, and then he started having a little bad luck. In fact, our whole family had a little bit of it. I don’t know whether it’s worth talking about or not. I never do talk it much . . .", "My fourteen year old sister either set herself afire, or caught afire accidentally. There’s two different stories got out about it. Anyway, she was having a little difficulty with her school work, and she had to stay home and do some work, and she caught afire while she was doing some ironing that afternoon on the old Kerosene stove. It was highly unsafe and highly uncertain in them days, and this one blowed up. It caught her afire and she run around the house about twice before anybody could catch her. Next day she died. And my mother — that one was a little bit too much for her nerves or something. I don’t know exactly how it was, but anyway my mother died in the insane asylum at Norman, Oklahoma. Then about that same time my father mysteriously, for some reason or another, caught afire. There’s a lot of people who say that he set himself on fire. Others say he caught afire accidentally. I always will think that he done it on purpose, because he lost all his money.", "All of my brothers and sisters, all these things happened and they found theirselves scattered. All us kids had to scatter out and be adopted by different families. I lived with a family of people. There was eleven of us, lived in a little two-room shack. We had two or three beds, you know, so we’d sleep some of us at the head and some of us at the foot, and had everybody’s feet in everybody’s faces. You know how that is. Then after that, I don’t know, I kind of took to the road. I hit the road one day. The first day that I ever hit the highway to be what’s called a rambling man or a hobo or a tramp was in 1927.", "LOMAX:: How old were you then?", "GUTHRIE:: At that time I was about seventeen years old.", "(Sounds of guitar strumming.)", "GUTHRIE:: So I went down to Galveston, Texas, hoed figs in all them orchards down in that country, helped drill water wells, irrigated strawberries, and helped a carpenter tear down a whole bunch of houses. And that time I was about eighteen.", "LOMAX:: Well Woody, did you begin to sing about this time? How did that happen?", "GUTHRIE:: Then I went back up into the panhandle of Texas. The big wheat belt. Up around Amarillo, Texas — north of Amarillo, Texas. When I got into that country, I got a job about the third day I was there. I got a job with a feller that owned a root beer stand, supposedly, and he said he’d give me three dollars a day to stand behind the counter and sell people root beer. So I told him I had the intelligence enough to do that. So I got around behind the counter, and he told me, ”Now, in addition to this root beer, here’s some bottles of another description. If anybody comes up and lays a dollar and a half on the counter here, why you reach down and gently and firmly let him have one of these here bottles.”", "One day my curiosity got the best of me, and I just got to wondering ”What in the devil is in them bottles?” So I opened up one and tasted of it, and it was nothing in the world but just unadulterated corn whiskey. So, we was a-wheelin’ and a-dealin’ there in the whiskey business for a long time. And this guy had a guitar that laid around there, and a lot of times there wouldn’t be any customers in this place, and I’d grab up this guitar and got to pecking around on it. I thought it sounded awful pretty. And learned a little old chord, just how to barely chord along, and finally learnt a just a few little old songs, and just kind of drifted into it. I never did own a guitar, though.", "LOMAX:: What were some of the first songs you began to sing out in the panhandle?", "GUTHRIE:: Here’s an old song here, that they sing back down in that country. Almost everybody knows it. The name of this one here is ”Greenback Dollar.”", "(Sings ”Greenback Dollar.”)", "GUTHRIE:: In this part of Texas where I was working in this whiskey store, some of the worst dust storms in the history of the whole world, I guess, broke loose. Here’s a picture, here, Allan — I’d like you to look at that. That there is the little town of Pampa, Texas. That’s where my wife and three children are living right now. I hear from them about twice a week.", "LOMAX:: Well, what happened the night that dust storm hit? Do you remember just exactly what you people did and what you said?", "GUTHRIE:: Well, you see the big picture here. It shows you the big dust storm coming up and uh, you know, just to see a thing of that kind coming towards you — wouldn’t know exactly what it was because it’s a freak looking thing. You never saw anything like it before. But we all sat there, we had seen dust storms of every other different color, labor, description, style, fashion, shade, design, model.", "Anyway, I remember the particular evening of April the fourteenth, 1935, that this dust storm here blowed up. I was standing, a whole bunch of us were standing just outside of this little town here that you see, and so we watched the dust storm come up like the Red Sea closing in on the Israel children. Anyway, we stood there watched the sun of a gun coming up. And I’m telling you it got so black when that thing hit, we all run into the house, and all the neighbors congregated in the different houses around over the neighborhood We sit there in a little old room, and it got so dark that you couldn’t see your hand before your face, you couldn’t see anybody in the room. You could turn on an electric light bulb, a good, strong electric light bulb in a little room and that electric light bulb hanging in the room looked just about like a cigarette burning. And that was all the light that you could get out of it.", "And so we got to talking to, you know, and a lot of the people in the crowd that was religious-minded and they was up pretty well on their scriptures, and they said ”Well, boys, girls, friends and relatives, this is the end. This is the end of the world.” And everybody just said, ”Well, so long, it’s been good to know you.” I made up a little song there — kind of one of my own making.

Now the thing is that Mr. Adler was the man who gave me the first interview, and this gentleman gave me the ten commandments of what the Folksbiene will need from you when you became a member: you coming to the rehearsal seven o’clock; you not asking for a part what you like; you asking that the director will give you the part; your not getting paid — not for playing and not for carfare; you have to be on time… And that was the beginning — I start my career at the Folksbiene.", "We have a lots to tell you. Theater is the richest place what you can express yourself. We never was sick; we never played with understudies. I had 103 temperature — I came to play. We got an old man that was with us 60 years, like Mr. Adler, and he fell on the stage and he got a cut on his forehead and they took him to the hospital. He said, ”Make the stitches now, because I have to finish the show.” They was sure that he didn’t know what he was talking. They brought him back, and he finished his show. He said, ”Nobody will take my place. I have to be here.” The devotion from the Folksbiene, from all the actors. When I started with the Folksbiene, it was 55 actors. Now it’s me, Zypora Spaisman, and Morris Adler — the two people from the Folksbiene. Mr. Adler, I didn’t like you very much for years — you remember? I hate you! Because he was looking for every little thing — ”Zypora no no no.” He was a tough man, and we love him.. And I’m very pleased to have Adler in this age.

She’s talking to the Virgin Mary, who is supposedly standing right in front of her. Pilgrims begin to weep. Time stops. I feel light-headed, dizzy, like I’m standing on top of a mountain. I’ve been told that when Mary appears, the picture in front of Estella does strange things for people. The mouth moves, the eyes come alive. I see nothing, but my heart feels hot in my chest.

Except that every once in a while, or so the voice in the exhibit’s accompanying telephone receiver would have us believe, one of them may inhale a microscopic spore of a fungus from the genus Tomentella, millions of which are raining down on the forest floor from somewhere in the canopy above. The spore quickly lodges in its ant host’s brain fomenting bizarre behavioral changes.", " ”The ant appears troubled and confused. For the first time in its life, the ant leaves the forest floor and begins to climb.”", "WESCHLER: It climbs the tendrils of hanging vines. It climbs and climbs, until it reaches a certain prescribed height at which point it impales its mandibles on the vine and waits to die.", " ”The fungus continues to consume first the nerve cells, and finally all the soft tissue that remains of the ant. After approximately two weeks, a spike appears from what had been the head of the ant. This spike is about an inch and a half in length and has a bright orange tip heavy with spores which rain down on the rain-forest floor for other unsuspecting ants to inhale.”", " We’ve read this ourselves as a metaphor for our own kind of obsessive behavior about this institution.

We don’t object to this, but we don’t exactly understand why. On the other end of the spectrum we have people for whom the museum is a much more solemn and serious place. We remember fondly a man called John Thomas, who when he first came to the museum spent at least three hours in the back, and when he came out he leaned his head against the wall and cried inconsolably for at least three minutes. My wife went over to him, and he said that he realized that it was a museum but to him it was like a church.", "WESCHLER: One day, for instance, when I was talking with David at his front desk, a visitor emerged from the maze-like alcoves stupefied.

Or Christ himself, crucified on a cross of hair.", "The first time I saw these canisters, I asked David if I could meet their supposed creator, this guy Sandaldjian.

Go to the library. Turns out it’s all true. Back in the 16th Century in a wonder cabinet outside of London, Mary Davis’s horn was on prominent display.

Israel Lutsky, the Jewish Philosopher. From 1931 to the mid-’60s, Lutsky took to the air daily with letters from listeners seeking advice. He replied with spoonfuls of folk wisdom and dollops of abuse.Charlatan or sage, Lutsky was one of the most beloved and listened-to figures from the golden age of Yiddish radio. No other radio personality delved so deeply into the personal lives of his listeners. From men lamenting overextended family business to women bemoaning no-good children, Yiddish-speakers of all stripes solicited Lutsky’s counsel on issues too sensitive for the ears of friends and relatives. His pronouncements on their fate veered in tenor from the singsong melody of Torah study to the gravity of an Old Testament patriarch in no way averse to sputtering rage. That the letters he expounded upon were written by his copywriter never diluted the strength of his convictions, or his determination to see his advice followed to a T.Short, pugnacious, and dapper to the point of risibility, the cigar-chomping Lutsky was an entertainer above all else. The “C” in his name stood for cantor, a role in which he had early success before going on to become an amateur pugilist, a vaudevillian, a socialist organizer, a cub reporter, and ultimately a radio personality. In this long-lived function he demonstrated a hypnotist’s talent in bringing his correspondents to life in listeners’ minds, turning private grief into public catharsis and transforming platitudes into pearls of wisdom.In short, the Jewish Philosopher was a snake-oil salesman, and as such knew it wasn’t enough to gather a crowd. He needed to sell, sell, sell — and he did it with cantorial fervor. His longtime sponsor, Carnation Milk, was so pleased with his impassioned promotions they awarded him a pension at his retirement.But shilling for sponsors was only the tip of the iceberg. Lutsky launched the Philosopher’s League, a kind of lonely heart’s club devoted to spreading his teachings. And he went multimedia, publishing a magazine dedicated to himself.Yiddish Radio ProjectYiddish Radio Project In 1937, in a bid to capitalize on the success of his radio show and his growing stature among listeners, C. Israel Lutsky launched the Jewish Philosopher’s League, Incorporated, “an organization that is truly a Cultural and Spiritual Cult,” and  magazine, its house organ. Promising “a successful challenge to loneliness of the heart … loneliness of the soul … loneliness of the spirit,” the league was in essence a matchmaking service built around the magnetic personality of its leader.Having paid the $10 initiation fee and $5 annual dues, league members could attend sponsored activities like dances, amateur drama classes, and boat rides. If the balance sheet totted up positive for Lutsky, no tally exists on aching hearts salved by the venture. Evidence does however exist that at least one heart was broken: by the Jewish Philosopher’s League treasurer, Morris Shimshak (see photo). (A little while later, Shimshak found himself on the outs, following a squabble with Lutsky about matters financial.)Endorsements of the league were dutifully penned into every  article, written by members of the league’s executive committee. True to its mission,  ran a biographical sketch of Lutsky, an open letter from Lutsky to his listeners, and a novelette based on the solution of a letter writer’s woes. The first issue, dated November 1937, was also the last.Day in, day out, for three decades running, Lutsky began his program with a freshly written tribute to the wonders of Carnation Milk. He lauded the economic efficiency of Carnation’s plants, the mysterious nutritional benefits of its powdered milk crystals, the allergy-preventing properties of its canned milk — all with the same emotion and sense of purpose that went into responding to “listener” letters. The force of Lutsky’s devotion was in full evidence when he summarily fired Isaiah Sheffer, his English-language announcer, for garbling a Carnation ad.Lutsky was so enamored of his patron that he always sported a white Carnation in his lapel and, for his vacations, toured Carnation plants across the country, prancing about like Napoleon at Austerlitz. It thus seems apt that one-third of the surviving recordings of the program feature Lutsky dispensing Carnation ads rather than the milk of human kindness."]}

At its outset his career comprised an all-Jewish repertoire that spanned from liturgical song to Yiddish popular music. But when he took to the Yiddish airwaves, the bill of fare diversified. Whatever song happened to be popular on American radio, his wife, Miriam Kressyn, translated into Yiddish and Rexite sang on one of his shows. He feared nothing, sang everything, and stayed on the air for the better part of five decades.The son of a cantor, Rexite (originally spelled Rechtzeit) started performing professionally while still in knickers — the “Wonder-Boy,” they used to call him. He hadn’t yet reached his teens when he sang before a special congressional committee and then at the White House in a bid to convince the United States government to allow his mother and sisters to emigrate from Poland. The command performance so moved President Calvin Coolidge he relented to the plea on the spot.Rexite was equally persuasive in the many venues he came to play, from Yiddish theater, radio, recordings, and film to regular gigs in upscale New York nightclubs like Billy Rose’s Diamond Horseshoe and the Casino de Paris. Excelling in each, Rexite was poised to hone the sort of musical crossbreed that formed the foundation for some of his best remembered songs.The blend had its roots in the 1943 marriage of Rexite and Miriam Kressyn, a popular Yiddish actress and singer in her own right. Kressyn proved an extraordinary talent at turning American standards into Jewish hits. Who could have guessed that show tunes from  would sound so good in Yiddish?The Kressyn-Rexite concoctions struck big with American Jews. Rexite’s smooth-as-scotch tenor won him Sinatra-like adoration from female fans. And Kressyn’s translations, always lyrical and often lampoons, pleased and surprised careful listeners. Example: “love and marriage,” in her rendition of the well-known 1955 hit of the same name, “geyt tzuzamen vi zup un knaydlakh” (go together like soup and dumplings) instead of “like a horse and carriage.”The team’s work also translated into highly successful advertising for Rexite’s radio sponsors, which included national clients like Ajax and Campbell’s Soup. While Rexite often guest-starred on lavishly produced shows like WHN’s “Yiddish Melodies in Swing,” the programs he created, like “The Barbasol Troubadour,” were all variations on a theme: Rexite, a microphone, and a pianist/organist. His accompanists included Sam Medoff, moonlighting from his gig as bandleader of “Yiddish Melodies in Swing,” and Abe Ellstein, who composed many of his hits.Seymour Rexite lived in lower Manhattan until his death, at the age of 91, in October 2002."]}

Banks was 21 at the time of the murder and has always professed his innocence. When given the opportunity to plead guilty in exchange for a seven-year sentence, he refused, saying he could not confess to a crime he did not commit. His trial lasted two and a half days. The state’s main witness has since recanted his testimony, citing police coercion. Banks’s sentence was overturned by the U.S. District Court, then reinstated by a Court of Appeals.Two weeks before the scheduled execution, the Whitehead and Banks families reflected on the past 22 years and what they might feel after the waiting was over.16 Years OldJuly 2, 1963 to April 11, 1980Wayne, our first child, was a sweet, naive, typical teenager who loved life. In his naiveté, he saw no meanness or evil in others. He always saw only their goodness. Upon his death, he left a loving family of two brothers (Darren and Jason), his parents (Jackie and Larry Whitehead), grandparents, great-grandparents, as well as numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins.Like his brothers who are also avid bowlers, at six years of age, Wayne started bowling in a youth bowling league. He quickly developed a passion for bowling and bowled on into high school. Throughout their bowling years, Wayne and his brother Darren won numerous local and state awards and were Arkansas State Doubles Champions. In his junior year at Texas High School (Texarkana, TX), Wayne applied for and won the first scholarship awarded by the Texarkana Junior Bowling Association based on his bowling achievements and scholastic record. As a tribute to him upon his death, this scholarship was renamed, “The Wayne Whitehead Memorial Scholarship” and is awarded yearly to a deserving junior or senior high school bowler.Not long before his death, Wayne had gotten a car and was so very proud of it. This car, a 1969 Ford Mustang, was his pride and joy. It needed some “fixing up,” but that made it even more special to him. His plans were to customize it to his liking, with his dad’s help, and have fun in the process. However, his plans for his car were never realized. He left our house on a Friday night to attend a high school dance. After the dance, he went to the bowling center. There he ran into Delma Banks, Jr. He worked with Banks at the Bonanza Steak House. The weather was rainy and messy, and Wayne gave Banks a ride home. After dropping a friend off at her house, they went to a local park. It was at this park that Banks murdered our son. He shot him in the back of the head and in his shoulder. Then, just to make sure, he shot him point blank between the eyes. This cold blooded murderer left our sweet boy in that park, took his car, and drove it to Dallas, TX, where he abandoned it on a Dallas street. The car was never found. Later, during the trial, Banks told a friend in Dallas that he “did a white boy just for the hell of it.”Banks was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death twenty years ago. He has been on death row at Huntsville, TX, all that time. He has filed appeal after appeal, after appeal, and has the NAACP fighting for him. In August 2000, the Federal courts granted him a new punishment phase, setting aside his death sentence. Now, Wayne’s family will go through all the torment of another trial with all the painful memories resurfacing. This case even attracted national attention because of the presidential election and George Bush being a candidate.In all this chaos, Wayne, the innocent victim, has all but been forgotten. To his family, he was a living, breathing, sweet, sweet boy before he met Delma Banks, Jr. To us he always will be just that. All we have left now are memories of Wayne, some that are nightmares and others that are oh, so sweet. That’s what Banks left us – just memories. Wayne was cheated out of so much at the hands of another person, and twenty years later his family still does not have closure and peace."]}

Lindbergh, the first man to fly the Atlantic. But does the name Charles A. Levine ring a bell? Likely not. Yet seventy-five summers ago the two men were locked in a battle for aviation history — one as a pilot, the other as a promoter.Levine, a 30-year-old millionaire who had made his money buying and selling World War One surplus materiel, had entered the competition for a $25,000 prize for the first person to complete a nonstop flight from New York to Paris. Lindbergh beat him to it on May 20, 1927, but the following day the young entrepreneur announced that his privately owned airplane would presently fly farther faster — and with a “mystery passenger” aboard. The pilot, he stated, would be one Clarence Chamberlin. The mystery passenger remained a mystery.On June 4, 1927, thousands gathered at Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York, to witness the takeoff. While they waited, Charles A. Levine climbed into the back of his plane and had Chamberlin taxi him around the airfield. No one thought much of it until the plane was halfway down the runway and gaining speed.Suddenly it was clear: The mystery passenger was none other than Levine himself. The millionaire’s wife fainted. His children wept. The press had a field day.Forty-two hours later, Levine and Chamberlin ran out of gas and landed safely in a peasant’s wheat field in central Germany. Despite being 40 miles short of the intended destination of Berlin, Chamberlin had smashed Lindbergh’s distance and speed record. And Levine had become the world’s first transatlantic air passenger — as well as an international hero whose face was plastered across newspapers from Europe to America.The euphoria was greatest among American Jews, for whom Levine was a new symbol of Jewish courage and fortitude. Yiddish radio stations and newspapers covered and re-covered the story and Jewish musicians wrote songs about him.It seemed Levine had made history.Yiddish Radio Project In the weeks following Levine’s triumph, the Jewish-American community was in a state of rapture as across the sea one of its own was received by European dignitaries from Hindenburg to Mussolini. On Manhattan’s Lower East Side, the Jews spoke of little else.“The anti-Semites in Germany and the anti-Semites around the world will have to take their hats off to Levine the Jew,” pronounced the New York Yiddish daily newspaper . “No longer will we be obliged to prove that Jews are as capable and strong on the field of physical bravery as on the field of intellectual achievements.”Within a month a half-dozen songs had been written in Levine’s honor. The transatlantic flyer was seen as heralding the advent of the modern Jewish hero: independent, courageous, and proud. Two of the songs made musical allusion to “Ha’Tikvah” (The Hope), the then unofficial Jewish national anthem. The implication was unmistakable: here was a defining character for Jewish aspiration.On February 28, 1937, a short article titled “Headliner Fades Out” ran in the back pages of the . A sort of living obituary, the piece chronicled the precipitous fall of an ephemeral modern legend.Since the summer of 1927, everything Charles A. Levine had touched ended in ruin. In 10 years he had lost everything: fortune, family, and fame — the latter returning momentarily in 1934, when, the  article reports, he was “found unconscious in the kitchen of a friend’s home, with five gas jets on.” In the eyes of the writer summarizing his life, Levine had sunk plenty low. In fact, he had a ways to go.A few months following the article’s appearance, the erstwhile headliner was back in the news, this time in connection with a Federal charge of tungsten smuggling. After spending 18 months in jail, Levine was eventually busted again, this time for the smuggling of an illegal alien. (The “alien” was a German Jew denied an American visa in his attempt to escape Hitler.)The former hero’s indignities were for a time thought amusing enough for newspaper back pages, but eventually even the tabloids lost interest. By the 1950s only the FBI cared to investigate further.Fifteen years after his tungsten smuggling conviction, Levine still owed the lion’s share of his $5,000 fine. In 1952 the Justice Department sought to ascertain whether the cash was recoupable.The Federal Bureau of Investigation operative assigned to the case picked up Levine’s scent in the shadowy world of New York rooming houses and dubious businesses. But laying hands on the former flier proved far more difficult. Levine had become a ghost, resurfacing sporadically among acquaintances to make a pitch or borrow a few bucks and then disappearing for days, weeks, or years at a time.No one, not even Levine’s daughter, knew where he lived or how he survived. Those who saw him remarked on the shabbiness of his suit and his evident lack of money. There was hardly a soul to whom he didn’t owe money. According to his notes, the FBI agent had trouble believing that Levine “was at one time a prominent newsworthy individual.”After evading the FBI for 26 months Levine was finally discovered in April 1956, thanks to a tip from a former business associate seeking revenge for an unpaid loan. But the task of catching Levine was still easier than getting him to cough up, and in 1958 the FBI closed the case without recovering a penny.Although the FBI ultimately failed in its mission, the paper trail it left behind illuminates an otherwise obscure chapter in Levine’s drawn out fall.Having finally hit rock bottom, Charles A. Levine stayed there for the remaining days of his life. He breathed his last on Dec. 6, 1991, cared for by an older woman who had picked him up off the street some 30 years earlier, having vaguely remembered his name from headlines of yore."]}

So we met, and we sat down, and we talked, and then I said to her, ”What would you like to do now if you could — anything you want?” And she said, ”Well, I’d go to an island in the Pacific somewhere where it’s nice and sunny.” It was winter. And I said, ”Well that we can’t do. That’s a little difficult.” So she said, ”I’d like to go see a movie.” I said, ”That’s reasonable. What’s the name of the movie?” She said, ”Uh, did you hear of a movie called ’Deep Throat’?” And I said, ”No, never heard of it.” I don’t go to movies, and so I knew nothing. She looks like a respectable woman–she was a very well-known public relations expert. Well, must be a respectable movie if there was a line around the block. It was a porno. It was the biggest porno of its time. I didn’t have the guts to say, ”Let’s go.” I was gonna sit through that come Hell or high water. And then, uh, we left, and I took her home, and I went back to my apartment in The Village. I thought about it — I thought, ”What gall of this woman! She doesn’t know me from Adam and take me to a movie like that.” I wouldn’t go to that movie if I’d known what it was — if they’d paid me for it. And then I thought, She has that chutzpah — that gall — I’ll call her again", "Elizabet Dwoskin: [Laughs]", "SS: And my granddaughter still laughs about that.

Just go get tested. So I went out to the gynecologist and got tested and about three weeks later the doctor’s office called me and said do you think you could come down and just give us some more blood and it’ll only take a few minutes and we’ll get you on your way.

Your test came back positive for HIV.” I started shaking the minute she said the words to me. In fact she came over and held on to me for about five minutes because I was crying so hard. Then the next thought was, I got to tell Dan. When he got diagnosed HIV positive he told me to knock off the guilt thing and that that’s hard to take when you’re the one who’s dealt out the disease, but Dan’s philosophy about life was that we only had this one to live and that no matter what this life was about we were going to live it to the fullest we could and even the days we were sick I don’t ever remember those days being so fraught with illness that there wasn’t something that we either smiled about or held between us.

If somebody wanted to start a business, he’d give them money. He got in a car accident with a guy one time and he was furious with the guy — he had a terrible temper — and by the end of the argument and whose fault was it anyway, he had loaned the guy $10,000 to start a restaurant. And a big bone of contention between my mom and him was how much money he gave away. So when he came home from working, he’d take all the money — he always had it in cash that he made — and he put it on the table and he’d let me count it. But it was more for my mother, so that she could see that he hadn’t given any away yet. And I’d always hear about this money, ”Did so and so ever pay you back?”  ”Well, not yet.”  And when he died, people started mailing back the money that they owed him, and letters starting coming in from everywhere about how my dad had helped them at this time in their lives.

You didn’t have to try him, he always pled guilty, and he was a likable person.

And his friend called the sheriff and told him that he had been robbed by Willie Earl, but he knew exactly where Willie was. So the sheriff went there and got him and locked him up. And when he came up before me of course he pled guilty again. And I got ready to sentence him. ”Come around, Mr. Dow. I am so disappointed I don’t know what to say. I have given you another chance and then you got in trouble again and I just don’t understand you.”", "Well he said, ”Well, Judge, I’m disappointed in you.” Everything in the courtroom got deathly quiet. He said, ”When I was here four years ago, you were sitting in that same chair, wearing that same robe, making that same speech. I figured a man of your caliber ought to at least be on the Supreme Court by now.” Well, I told him, ”Mr. Dow, I was going to sentence you to five years, but since you are so perceptive, I think I’ll just give you three years.”", "Which I did. Well, later, when I retired they had a little ceremony there in the courtroom to hang my portrait. And in walks Willie Earl Pip Dow.

For example, imagine a parrot flies along; the parrot lands on a car; the car explodes; and the smoke and feathers rise in a figure eight. That represents a word for me. That word is polycarbonate. Poly is the parrot, the car is a car, the explosion is like a bomb, and the 8 is an 8. I used to convert about 10,000 words into these pictures every semester.

I’d be there late at night or I’d come in on Sundays and print out emails so I could underline and circle words as I read them.

And I was sitting there at my desk and I looked over to the doorway of the classroom and I could see the teacher peeking in with this scared look on her face. And I saw a couple of my classmates’ heads kind of under her face and over her face. And my math book was on the floor and so was a pencil and all these desks were empty. That image stayed in my head for years.", "CG: And your family, how did they respond to your seizures growing up?", "MG: I’d be coming out of a seizure and hear my father saying, ‘Why does this have to happen to her, what did we do wrong?’ My mother would often be praying over me or putting holy water on my forehead. She was determined to find me the best in terms of medicine. And there was always this hope on her part that her little girl was going to find a cure. So I would see tons of doctors and they would try many different medications. And when I was in my twenties they suggested that I would be a candidate for brain surgery. But back then, in ‘83, when I had the surgery it was fairly new. And my mother — after all those years of trying to get me cured — the thought of them opening up their daughter’s head scared the hell out of her. And I don’t think she could bear the thought of loosing me. So, that morning, she begged me not to do it. And I looked at her, I kissed her forehead and said, ‘Mommy get out of the room.’ It was a seven-hour surgery. I remember laying in a hospital room for three weeks. Man, I’ve never prayed so much in my life.", "CG: How has your life changed since that surgery?", "MG: It is a completely different life. I’ve gone from someone who is shy and withdrawn, scared of when I’d have the next seizure, and now the whole world is open to me."]}

My daughter was 2 years old, a few days later she just started screaming and crying, calling her mother. That’s when it hit me. And then the first week of January, right shortly after New Years, two police detectives rang my door bell and they told me that they had found part of her–just the upper torso. And um, I guess I was so numb I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know what to say. We were married ten years. We talked about everything and she always made me see the better side of things, always. That was one of the things that I cherished about her the most. Whenever I feel down I just go over there to the gravesite and I uh, talk to her about the girls. And it makes me feel like she’s still with me and that I can go see her anytime and go talk to her anytime. The cemetery’s big and sometimes I realize I’m driving by where she’s buried at, but I’m supposed to be somewhere else. Like, What the hell am I doing down here. I’m supposed to be on the other side of the cemetery. When I get like that, then I say ‘You know what? I need to go see her’. So, the next day, when I come in, I go straight there and I stop. It’s gonna be already what, fourteen years. And um, when I cross the bridge every morning, I see the city and it just doesn’t look the same anymore. I just see that new tower there but um, I can’t see myself going there for no reason at all. Her name is Rosa Maria Feliciano. She’s buried here, so Green-Wood Cemetery is ground zero for me."]}

I once told someone that I learned to fight with a knife long before I learned how to ride a bicycle. And when you are grinding day after day after day, there is no room in you for hope. There just isn’t. You don’t even know it exists. There’s nothing to aspire to except filling your hungry belly. That’s how I was raised. But when I was 12, a bookmobile came to the fields. And you have to understand that I wasn’t allowed to have books, because books are heavy, and when you’re moving a lot you have to keep things just as minimal as possible. So when I saw this big vehicle on the side of the road, and it was filled with books, I immediately stepped back. Fortunately when the staff member saw me, kind of waved me in, and said, “These are books, and you can take one home. You have to bring it back in two weeks, but you can take them home and read them.” I’m like, “What’s the catch?” And he explained to me there was no catch. Then he asked me what I was interested in. And the night before the bookmobile had come, in the camps, there was an elder who was telling us about the day that Mount Rainier blew up, and the devastation from the volcano. So I told the bookmobile person that I was a little nervous about the mountain blowing up. And he said, “You know, the more you know about something, the less you will fear it.” And then he gave me a book about volcanos. And then I saw a book about dinosaurs. I said “Oh, that looks neat.” So he gave me a book about dinosaurs. And I took them home, and I devoured them. I didn’t just read them, I devoured them. And I came back in two weeks and had more questions. And he gave me more books and that started it. That taught me that hope was not just a word. And it gave me the courage to leave the camps. That’s where the books made the difference. By the time I was 15, I knew there was a world outside of the camps. I believed I could find a place in it. And I did."]}

We were like 13 years old and my mother said, ”You can’t go back to school, you’re going to have to find a job.” So I went to the country club.

All my friends told me I was crazy but I saw something that no one else could see, and that is me walking around with that big tall hat on. So I counted how many positions it was from washing dishes to the executive chef. And we had like a three room house. So what I did, I had my chart pinned to the wall in our little outdoor bathroom there and I would mark every time I got a promotion, And then I would turn the light off and I would dance. And I would sing ”Johnny B. Goode” and I changed it to ”Clayton B. Goode, you’re so good.” You know I didn’t mind all the hard work–actually I loved it. I worked the whole weekend without going home. And I worked myself up to sous-chef, and there was this guy named Frank Cahey who was executive chef. He told me one day, he said, ”I know what you’re trying to do. You think you’re going to be the chef here.” He said, ”But I’m going to be here for life.” He said ”You might as well either keep working under me or go somewhere else.” So what I did, I was sneaky. You know in the back of trade magazines there are articles in there looking for chefs all over the country. I wrote one of the best looking resumes and signed Frank Cahey’s name on it, and sent it to all of these head hunters all over the country. And he actually thought he was famous, he said everybody knows about him. But he didn’t know it was me that did it. And the general manager got tired of it. He’s like, ”Frank, every time you come to me for raises, and people want you here, people want you there.” He said, ”Right now, at this very moment, I consider you dead.” Frank, he turned white as a sheet and he said, ”Well what are you going to do?” He said, ”Well Clayton, can you take care of it until we find another chef?” I said ”I’ll be more than happy to.” That’s all I needed.

But I’m gonna race.’ I can remember him racing in Jacksonville and he beat them all. But they wouldn’t drop the checkered flag.

He needed an operation. And I said, ’Daddy, we don’t have to race today.’ He whispered to me and said, ’Lift my legs up and put me in the car.’ So, I took my arms and put behind his legs and I kind of acted like I was hugging him and helped him into the car.

Where other drivers that we were competing against had major sponsorships, providing them engineers, as many cars as they needed, he did everything that he did out of his own pocket. He always felt like someday he’s gonna get his big break. But, uh, for twenty years nobody mentioned Wendell Scott. At one point it was like he never existed. But he didn’t let it drive him crazy.

At the time, I was tutoring at an after-school program for some extra money. And these kids came from the same conditions that the people that murdered my father came from. A student came to the after-school program, was probably around 16 years old. We were doing something where everyone had to read out loud, and he stormed out the classroom. And I went out to talk to him. And he just broke down. He said, “It’s hard for me to read.” There are many people that cry because they’re hurt, they’ve been neglected; but to cry because you couldn’t read. That spoke volumes to me. So we got him in some other programs and he start to read and it just was like this gift that money can’t buy for him. And by me giving that to him, I totally forgot about the pain of the murder, and I wanted to continue to give more of what I had–to heal. It just dawned on me: Everybody at some point sits in a classroom. That could be the foundation for everything else. So that’s when I said that whatever happened to my father is not gonna be in vain.

I’m Bill Schifrin and I specialize selling wedding rings to the public and I have such a good time doing it. I’m always working 24 hours a day. When I would see a couple on the street, kissing, in a clinch, I would tap their shoulder–the fella–I would hand the fella a card. You know why? Because married couples don’t kiss on the street. Years ago, it used to be very busy on Friday afternoons. The couple would come and he would let her pick a wedding ring and give me a check as a deposit. Monday he would come in alone and say, ’Tear up the check, we changed our minds. But thank you for a beautiful weekend.’ I had a girl once who wanted to buy a wedding ring for her fiancée. She says, ’Tell me, if he doesn’t like it, can I give it back to you?’ I said, no, this is a custom job. I’m making the ring special for your fiancée. She gave me the order and gave me the deposit and said, ’This is what I want engraved in there: No refunds. No returns.’ I couldn’t get over that. I’m married 66 years and I still get along with my wife. Met her in a dance and I had to go into the army. Got married on a furlough. Went to the jewelry store, got the plainest wedding ring. Seven dollars. My lucky day. I always wondered, Who invented this that if you get married you have to have a wedding ring? Somebody figured out something, and it worked for me."]}

Gradually as the black population in town began to go down, that left my mother there at the school as the principal, the janitor, whatever was needed, she had to do everything. And, as long as there was one black child left in town, they had to keep the school open. So 10, 9, 8, mother was there till the last child, the last family was forced out of town. So I remember one day, mother and I got into the old station wagon because mother had heard that the school was going to be torn down. We went inside the school, we got whatever records we could find, we put them in the back of the station wagon. Then, a big bulldozer came and dug a deep hole, and after digging this deep hole, just pushed our beloved school in the hole and covered it up…and it was as though it was, um, never there. Years later, when I was, uh, in graduate school, people would talk about, uh, urban renewal and… All of those kinds of ideas in my classes, I had a particular perspective. To me, urban renewal meant that they’ll dig a deep hole and push your school, cover it up and it will be like the school never existed or you never existed. I’ll never forget those days. Even today, this town of Sheridan, Arkansas is an all-white town. And if you ever have an opportunity, uh, to go through that town, drive very slowly."]}

I was pretty athletic when I was little and at the time my hero was Bob Feller, and I was going to be a major league pitcher like Bob Feller so I picked out Freddie Armond, who was the oldest guy, and uh, I hit him right in the middle of the forehead and it decked him.", "RSmith: Did it draw blood?", "RS: It drew plenty of blood.

He said, I’m going to give you a whipping. I was scared to death. About that time my brother, Frank, came down the side of the house on his bicycle and skidded into the front yard and dropped the bicycle and said, You know, What’s going on? And so Mr. Armond said, Your brother has laid open my son’s head and I’m going to give him a whipping. And so my brother Frank said, No sir. And he said, What do you mean sonny? He said, My name’s Frank, sir. And you’re not going to give him a whipping. Frank was about 5’9 and Mr. Armond was probably about 5’8. His son was standing there and my brother said, You’re going to have to whip me first sir and I don’t believe you can do it. My father can take care of this and my family can take care of this, and I will not let you touch my brother without coming through me first. He backed off and they left.

And, in the basement of the hospital, in a windowless room, they pack the surgical instruments before surgery. Each surgery has a list of all the instruments they need. And at the top of the list is the patient’s name, and the technician is given this list and it’s up to her, or to him, to pack these instruments and take them up to the OR for the particular surgery. One of the women told me that as she packed these instruments, and she knew the patient’s name, she would pray for that patient. And that she had been doing that for forty years. And, I thought, no one knows that she’s doing this. Here she is, a person who has been working at that hospital for longer than most of us, who is doing this incredibly important job, that has to be done precisely and carefully, as she’s doing this she’s praying for the patients she will never meet and the patients that she’ll never see, she’ll never know the outcome, she only knows that she’s helping to make their surgery possible. And, then I found out that most of them did it. You know, people work really hard and are so essential, but often not seen by patients and families.

And I always said, ”Three strikes may be an out in baseball, but life is not baseball.” And so in 1992, I ran for the United States Congress. And this time, I won. I don’t know, there was just something that kept telling me that you have got to stick this out.

He was looking for money, so he had dumped out the hamper and came across the two shells. I got yanked off the couch and put on all fours.

The kids are only two rooms away, and they’re going to hear the shotgun blast, and they’re going to wake up, and they’re never going to forget that my brains are all over.” And I kept telling him it. And what seemed like forever, which could have only been seconds, he finally put the gun down, drug me to the back room, and beat the hell out of me.

The ones that I do have, I kind of cling to uh…. When I was five I started to get a loose tooth and I told mom it was ready to come out and she said, ”Oh, well, wait till Daddy gets home, that’s his job.”", "So he got home and started to go to work on it and when it was over he told me all these stories about the tooth fairy, you know, what it would be like when she came and what fairies were like. So when I went to bed that night I was so excited. My sister and I shared a bedroom and I put my tooth under my pillow and woke up the next morning and I stuck my hand under the pillow and pulled out my tooth. Mommy and Daddy were eating breakfast so I held out my hand with the tooth on it. Momma started to say something and Daddy just threw his hand out and stopped her and said, ”Ray is at the end of the alphabet, the tooth fairy must have been really busy last night, you’ve got to go back to bed… now!”", "So I crawled into bed and I started to dose off and then I heard these footsteps coming down the hallway. So I shut my eyes really quickly and I thought, ‘Don’t fairies fly?’ And then I felt this presence over my face and this large hairy hand slide under the pillow and I thought, ‘Aren’t fairies tiny little women?’", "So I peaked through my lashes and I saw the door shutting and the back of a baldhead that looked just like my dad’s. And I sat up and I pulled my quarter out. And my sister came in from the shower so I figured Vicky’d know because she was twelve and she knew everything. So I said, ‘I don’t think there is a tooth fairly, I think it’s Daddy.’ And she said, ”What makes you say that?” And I told her what I’d seen and she said, ”That was the gentle giant. He helps the tooth fairy when she’s busy.”", "I said, ‘Daddy didn’t say anything about a giant.’ So she followed me to the kitchen and before I could say a word, she said, ”Daddy, Lisa doesn’t believe me about the gentle giant even though she just saw him.”", "And Daddy looked at me without missing a beat and said, ”Of course! I told you about that yesterday.”", "I almost argued and then I suddenly realized that I had a mouthful of teeth and each one was worth a quarter… (laughing)", "You know… that story… I’ve held onto that all those years because my dad really messed up… (laughing) it was my chance to see him as a human being. And it made me really happy that I had that one solid memory. I think every kid needs to see their parent as a human being."]}
